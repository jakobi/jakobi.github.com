[- qw! "$0" ${1:+"$@"}; exit; reinvoke with embpexec! -]

[# above is an example on invoking embperl by executing the
   template itself given a wrapper '[-'.

   below is the code to work around the misfeature that embpexec
   (used for static commandline generation of html from phtml) doesn't
   really know about object / root and other nice embperl features.
   So we cannot just load base.epl automagically, but need to
   explicitely Execute base.epl, and have base.epl Execute us
   once again. Which explains the 

   [ * ... else { * ] FILE CONTENT [ * } * ][ # MUST BE AT EOF! # ]

   Must be invoked with the EMBPERL_PATH set to all plausible
   locations of base.epl. This kind of fakes inheritance features
   missing from embperl.

   export EMBPERL_PATH="$SRC/$i/$l:$SRC/$i:$SRC/HTML/$m-doc/$l:$SRC/HTML/$m-doc:$SRC/HTML";
   embpexec "$j" > "$DST/HTML/$m-doc/$k"

   Finally we use %ENV for communication between templates use for
   a single output file, as maintaining state in the apache /var
   directory when using embperl (%sdat, ...) really goes against
   the grain (and against the permissions in /var I want to
   keep).
