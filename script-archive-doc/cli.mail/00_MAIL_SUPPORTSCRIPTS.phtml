<p>Some  support  scripts for dealing with mail. Mlnn, the mutt  setup
and  the procmail setup is probably way too specific, so I'll  exclude
it for now (is procmail still being actively maintained at all??)</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>mygrepmail</b>. The original code's strictly functional and a pleasure
       to read. Partly because of this I'm still unwilling to fork this one for real.
       Then again, it's a pity that the classic grepmail doesn't know about MIME at all.
       So here's a modified interim version that (temporarily) de-mimes anything greppable
       just before the grep. Though it still has some 'modern times' problems with 
       e.g. encoding mixtures. 
</ul>
