<H1>Peter's Script-Archive - Overview</H1>

<hr>

<p>A  small  archive of 20 years of Unix and Linux Lore: programs  and
scripts with a slight flavoring of configuration scraps and notes. The
commands in the archive work with Linux (unless noted differently) and
quite  likely  were also used in earlier incarnations on various  Unix
versions.</p>

<p  class=anno>Some  grizzled  veterans  date  back  to   pre-historic
(non-)Unix   systems  and  perl3,  various  dialects  of  REXX,   M68K
assembler,              K&amp;R-C              (too              often
"unintentional-assembler-cum-obfuscation-contest";  compare that  with
perl, which at least <i>only allows</i> for "intentional obfuscation",
and  has some additional expressive power to offer as compensation for
those  stretches  of  kermit-injected  line  noise)  or   <i>worse</i>
(portable   awk  in  a  mixed  nawk/awk/oawk  multi-node-multi-version
environment - oh joy!). A select few even had a language-change or two
thrown  in.  But  most of these better remain resting in  the  archive
dirtree  along with a fond memory of their associated environment  and
hardware;  besides, is there really anyone being still afflicted  with
these  programs'  raison d'etre like e.g. coping with PCL or  floppies
:)?</p>

<H3>Status and Updates</H3>

<p>Status  of the commands checked into this archive: I do  <b>not</b>
use  this  archive for development, but rather use a script to  export
the   currently  used  versions  to  the  archive  once  in  a  while.
<b>Bugs</b>:  Given  the  small size of the commands I do  not  use  a
consistent  test  harness  setup,  thus the pushed  version  may  also
contain  recent breakage until the next export. <B>So if you encounter
a  bug  or  a "wishlist-time", drop me a mail</B> with  or  without  a
patch;  I'm  interested  in fixing them or I might already  fixed  the
problem locally.</p>
