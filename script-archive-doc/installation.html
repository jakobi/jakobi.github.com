<H1>Peter's Script-Archive - Installation</H1>

<hr>

<H2>Assumptions on the runtime environment / Bugs / Portability</H2>

<p>Note  that  while some stuff might cope with just POSIX, I  usually
silently  assume  a proper Unix environment including perl,  bash  and
optionally  ksh  (ATT ksh aka ksh93, not PD-KSH), with a  sane  LOCALE
setting.  Most of the shell scripts are bash, but should work with ksh
as  well  as long as they don't depend on arrays or  more  interesting
forms of command substitution. </p>

<p>Some  (perl)  scripts might still make the assumption that  /bin/sh
supports  set -o pipefail, which e.g. for recent debian/ubuntu may  no
longer hold, as those system might use dash instead of ksh or bash.</p>

<p><i>Do  drop  me a line</i> if you run in such a /bin/sh or bash  vs
ksh93  problem,  esp. if it concerns one of the  non-trivial  scripts.
Also  in case you wish to run the scripts on the BSDs, Solaris, or AIX
(or HPUX) and run into problems.

<p  class=anno>Most scrips should be usable with little effort, but  I
tend  to  only test and use scripts on the scripts'  immediate  target
platform,  which  for  my  personal  desktop  and  LAN  setup  is  90%
Ubuntu/Centos.  Note  that I will need a bit of extra help  from  your
side  in  case of HP-UX, as I stopped keeping my setup current  around
the initial 11i version.</p>

<p   class=anno>However   please   <i>don't</i>  mail   in   case   of
tcsh/csh/PD-KSH-related  stuff or things like making nico_cd cope with
dash.  If  you're using the BSDs, the pd-ksh vs. ksh93 issue is a  bit
more critical there than on other Unix systems.</p>

<p  class=anno>On the Locale issue: read up on LC_COLLATE when  you're
using  some of the posixish-correctly-broken UTF-8 locales, which make
a  mess  of shell globs like [A-Z]* to suddenly match also files  like
cannotbematchwithuppercase.</p>



<H2>Help, Man-Pages and Examples</H2>

<p>Help  for non-trivial scripts is usally available with --help (very
old  scripts  still use -h/-help). The longer scripts may  also  offer
additional  help  sections like --example(s). All scripts begin with
a comment block detailing notes, restrictions and bugs.</p>

<p>Man pages: Currently there are none.</p>

<p>To  keep scripts self-contained, I usally avoid separate files like
man  pages which need to be strictly synchronized which each other. So
for  the  major  scripts like emv/sfre, in the  future,  I  <i>may</i>
choose  to  reformat a subset of --help into a man page for a  generic
command  overview.  The pod route might also work, but at the  moment,
it's just not my itch (yet).</p>



<H2>On the placement of perl auxilliary files and configurations</H2>

<p>For  testing  one  of the scripts with dependencies, it  should  be
sufficient to place any required commands in the same directory as the
script itself and add that directory to the $PATH. This also works for
configuration files and my perl modules.</p>

<p  class=anno>I'm  a bit of a believer of self-contained scripts,  so
I'm  slightly  dissatisfied with the  Install-Kitchensink-Approach  to
finally  run  a tool that uses the kitchensink but itself  degenerated
into  mere  argument  handling.  Still, you sometimes have  a  bit  of
non-trivial    reusable    code   that   doesn't   seem   right    for
reuse-at-external-tool-level                  (e.g.                 <a href="cli.list.grep/00%5FLISTPROCESSING.html">Grep.pm/Grep.xchange</a>,
or                                                                  <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/cli.lock/">lock.pl
and  Flock.pm</a>).  Generalizing the creation of a perl function  for
booleans  expressions  might become a candidate, but  abstracting  the
differing  uses  and  argument  handling styles (string  vs  regex  vs
synonym-expanding vs index-for-filename into array) would make it very
hard to avoid veritable kitchensink-style bloat while also littering a
previously  readable  one-page function with a mess of  callbacks  and
closures.</p>

<p  class=anno>In the old days, that meant a 'do "$0.FILE";' to  allow
placing  the library file into the same dir as the tool (my early 90's
perl4/perl5 db_cgi.pl grab bag comes to mind). A no-hassles approach I
still like for configuration files.</p>

<p  class=anno>Nowadays I'm keeping the module collection in a  subdir
below the tools, but I've some code in any module-using perl script to
retain  a  bit  of  flexibility  in  the  placement  of  the  modules:
&lt;same-directory&gt;,  ~/bin,  ~/bin/perl, ~/bin/perl/Compact,  with
the  module  now  being invoked by it's relative  name:  'use  Flock;'
instead of the proper 'use Compact_pm::Flock' which requires a placing
Flock.pm in a Compact_pm dir in some directory in @INC).</p>

<H2>Download</H2>

<p>To  download  a  file, go the directory of interest  using  the  <a href="http://jakobi.github.com/script-archive-doc/">filelist</a>    or
the <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/">git view of the
repository</a>,  select  the file you're interested in and choose  the
'raw  link'  to  download. You can also clone the whole  archive  with
<tt>git  clone git://github.com/jakobi/script-archive.git</tt> or grab
a   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tarball/master">
current tar-ball</a> (about 500K tar.gz).</p>
