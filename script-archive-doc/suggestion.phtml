<H2>Tool Selection</H2>

<p>The immediately usable scripts probably are</p>
<ul>
  <li><B>cat0/cat0par</B>: conversion from/to \0-based lines; also 
       allows  use of grep/sort/... with arbitrary record-based files
  <li><B>emv</B>: for interactive  mass-renaming files using your favorite editor.
       Not just for renaming.
  <li><B>Grep.pm</B>: extended grep using boolean expression on top of regex or perl,
       with highlighting, synonyms, etc; use with vim.pipe and Grep.xchange for
       emv-style semi-interactive mass-editing of files.
  <li><B>tagls</B>: use tags on the commandline to describe sets of files: 
       turn arbitrary file names and lists of filenames into 
       searchable collections of tagged file names.
  <li><B>waitcond</B>: wait for events like 'make has finished' by 
       building arbitrary boolean expressions over a language of tests like
       existance-of-file, recent-file-modification, grep-in-file-or-command-output, 
       diskidle/netidle/cpuidle, successful-ping, successful-shell-commands, or 
       just plain ps-visible processes.
  <LI><B>waitcond.timeout</B>: run a shell command and kill it after a timeout, which
       might be the return of a second shell command.
  <li><B>zap</B>: perl-camel-book process-killer that by now learned about
       process trees, and the non-mortal arts of process listing and nicing.
</ul>

<p>A bit more special-interest are</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>firefox wrapper</b>: To access firefox bookmarks 
       (both html as well as sqlite versions),
       opened  tabs,  etc, from the shell, have a look at  the firefox
       wrapper set of scripts
   <li><b>mygrepmail</b>: If  you  liked  <B>grepmail</B>, the archive
       contains  a  butchered version that doesn't give up when confronted with MIMEs.
   <li><b>sfre</b>: Still  a  bit experimental,  <b>systemflightrecordereditor</b>'s
       goal  is sequencing changes and augmenting group memory in  concurrent
       file  change  scenarios,  like multiple administrators using  root  or
       administrator  vs cron. For each edit (or more generally run  command)
       it  logs a description to a journal, f-locks the plain file  arguments
       of  the  command and uses changetrack to backup changes.  It  requires
       changetrack (changetrack.sf.net) and lock.pl.
</ul>

<p>Some shell functions of interest are</p>
<ul>
   <li> <B>_echo</B> (a version of ksh's print, honoring --, thus safe for echoing arbitrary files)
   <li> <B>f2a</B> (reads lines from files into an array, the safe multiple-file pendant of "$(command)")
   <li> <B>uniqpath</B> (strip duplicates or . from :-path-style strings)
   <li> a modified <B>nico_cd dir stack</B> working in both bash and ksh93
</ul>
