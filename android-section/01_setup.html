<p>Also                  see                  the                   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/android">Android
directory  of  the  script-archive</a>.</p>

<p>Besides some scripts, this directory contains a mothballed snapshot
of  my working Android environment intended to complement the articles
below (android-setup-example-files.tgz).</p>

<p>In  it  you  find the scripts for the Android  shell,  a
collection  of static armel binaries, the tree structure of the chroot
on  the  Galaxy note, as well as scripts and configuration files  used
for monitoring, backup, etc from a remote Linux server via cron.</p>

<p>Current  versions of the more interesting scripts will be placed in
above   directory   (if   Android-specific)  or   elsewhere   in   the
script-archive (parts of my bash/ksh setup or generic Unix stuff).</p>

<p>Most  of the article should also hold for other recent  gingerbread
devices,  the  generics also for all newer Android devices. When  I've
installed  ICS  on the Note (middle 2012 I'd assume), I will  add  ICS
errata at the end of each part.</p>

<a name=firstlook></a>
<H3>A first look at the Note / Web-Resources / Rooting</H3>

<p>This  article  sketches  a sane setup of GNU/Linux on  an  ordinary
<B>1-GB-RAM   DUAL-CORE  PC</B>  (henceforth  called   the   armel
architecture  Android device <b>Samsung Galaxy Note</b> GT-N7000).

<p>This hardware is more than enough for a moderate desktop PC that is
not  used  for heavy gaming, virtualization or video editing. In  this
article,   I'm   not  interested  in  audio/video   input/output   nor
phone/s-pen/sensor/camera use.</p>

<p>Web Resources of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.androidnz.net/2011/12/samsung-galaxy-note-complete-review.html">AndroidNZ review with some app suggestions</a>
<li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1349">XDA Note forum</a>
</ul>


<p>I/O options of the Note include</p>
<ul>
<li>the OTG USB port, which permits to connect
<ul>
<li>the Note to the PC (adb, access to 
    the Note's FAT user filesystems) or
<li>some external USB hardware
    to the Note (mouse/keyboard/memory stick, etc, as long as an in-kernel
    driver is available)
<li>the HDMI connection cable (reusing the physical OTG port)
</ul>
<li>acting as either a WLAN-client or a WLAN Access Point
<li>networking over USB
<li>the S-pen - a real wacom-style stylus offering pressure-sensitivity
    and high resolution (not one of the iphone-style capacitive 
    finger-tip-replacements; better quality tablet-PC pens do work
    on the Note offering both eraser and stylus)
<li>...
</ul>


<p>Flash  considerations: Choose a <i>quality</i> sdhc microsd  flash,
with  a size of 16 or 32GB. Read speeds for the internal flash are 50+
MB/s  and  18MB/s  for the external (as measured with  hdparm  for  my
Sandisk class 4).</p>

<p  class=anno>After bad experiences with both Class 10 Transcend  and
Lexar,  I've  now settled on a reliable Sandisk class 4  16GB  microsd
flash.  As Sandisk chooses labels according to the minimum write rate,
it  is nearly as fast as the others. One advantage is that I no longer
find the chroot remounted read-only, as this means to shutdown/restart
the chroot and running fsck (no loss of data though). When switching I
had  a  look at the external sdcard's FAT filesystem and  my  titanium
backup files:  Massive  data corruption. Flash problems may well  have  been
worsened  by  whatever timeout changes Google patched  into  the
kernel.</p>



<p>Power  considerations: to save battery,</p>
<ul>
<li>enable automatic battery savings  in Settings.
<li>turn off WLAN and GPS - the location by cell towers is still
pretty exact. 
<li>if necessary, you can also use <i>titanium backup</i> to freeze
some of the more annoying and power hungry apps in your firmware (kies, socialhub).
</ul>

<p>Known pitfalls to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>adb</i> and using symlinks in Android-side paths - silent failure.
<li>bad flash (in all possible meanings)
<li><i>kies</i> (connectivity suite / flashing software provided by Samsung for Windows)
<li>use of app2sd: do move all apps to the phone (/data) - the core of
    the Android framework has <B>MAJOR PROBLEMS</B> with apps on sdcards,
    upto and including hanging in a boot-loop (recover by full wipe or
    by <i>adb shell</i> from the PC and removing any packages on the sdcards;
    access by ssh with <i>sshdroid</i> is not possible).
</ul>



<h4>The Whys of Rooting</H4>

Besides  getting faster access to upstream security and bug fixes than
by  waiting for something to trickle down from Google to Hardware Maker
to Provider to OTA distribution, rooting enables more options for

<ul>
<li>backup/restore
<li>battery management
<li>privacy (<i>lbe privacy guard</i>, <i>aspotcat</i>, ...; iptables-based "personal" outbound firewalls)
<li>routing (improved tethering and intelligent "routing" at ip route/iptables level)
<li>security (<i>lookout</i>, <i>avast</i>; the ability to create a real iptables-based inbound packet-filter/firewall)
<li>access to non-Android programs, for the Android shell or for a chroot containing a real Linux install
</ul>

Depending  on how you root the device, the flash counter may  increase
(though                             that                            <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1354888">301K
resistor  field  testing jig</a> may help). But in case of mailing  in
the  device for service, you need to reflash a stock firmware  anyway.
Thus for me, the conclusion was: <i>so what</i>.




<h4>A Sabbatical for Research</h4>

<p>ROMs  are very device specific, so Android ecosystem and  community
are  <i>extremely fragmented</i>: <b>Good community support and custom
ROMs  are IMHO a pre-requirement when buying Android devices</b>. Some
custom  ROMs  reuse  stock  kernels, some  use  custom  kernel  builds
(usually   based   on the Android  Open  Source  Project/AOSP;   e.g.
cyanogenmod).</p>

<p   class=anno>Bad  makers  or  lack  of  community  lead  to   early
obsolescence  of the device and wasted money (consider the  disastrous
Motorola  Milestone).  Depending on the number of non-standard  chips,
various firmware-blobs might be required to get a fully working kernel
/  firmware. With some makers not even supporting devices at start  of
sale,  the initial release kernel might well be the only Linux  kernel
ever working on a device (again the Milestone example). This will also
worsen  community  support  and  shorten  availability  of   community
firmware  for this maker's devices (as any ROM would have to reuse the
old, unmaintained and probably also buggy kernel). <b>Some</b> of this
is  already  visible for the Note as well: the unofficial  CM9  builds
currently still lack blobs for camera and accelerated display.</p>

<h4>Pre-Flashing Checklist</h4>


<ul>
<li>create and validate a backup suitable to recover ALL of your device from a 
    barebones custom ROM install.
<ul>
   <li>if not yet installed, do install <i>titanium backup</i> from market.
   <li>if still unrooted, and you do need a backup of user apps, consider e.g. <i>mybackup</i>.
   <li>if possible, ensure that you have a copy of the /efs contents somewhere (IMEI!)
   <li>consider backups of your "sdcards": /mnt/sdcard and /mnt/sdcard/external_sd.
   <li>consider a backup of /data, even if only <i>tar cf /sdcard/data0.tar /data</i>
   <li>consider using <i>titanium backup</i> to backup user/system apps and data.
   <li>validate your backup!
   <li>consider using cfroot/cwm to do a backup from the recovery ROM:
       way faster than titanium to recover the previous state, but not
       that useful on restoring user data into a new custom ROM, as it
       is easy to restore "too much".
   <li>consider copying the backup to your PC! If that happens 
       automatically as part of a nightly backup run, do manually check that copy!
</ul>
<li>ensure that USB-debugging is enabled and <i>adb shell</i> still works
<li>check the battery level!
</ul>


<h4>The Way of Rooting (Tourist Travel Sketch, with dog-eared threads)</h4>

<p>At the end of the research phase, you should have selected a target
custom  ROM, and maybe one or more intermediate steps if you start out
with  a stock ROM. In my case the sequence led from stock back in time
to  a full install of the older KJ1 with CFROOT/CWM, and then  forward
again  to  Chris_X 4lph4 ROMs offering KL8 using the AbyssNote  2.6.35
kernel.</p>

<p><i>Stock to Chainfire KJ1 including the modified factoryfs</i> (see
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1331784">posting
1+2</a>).  If  your  ROM doesn't offer CFROOT/CWM, you first  need  to
install  a version of <i>odin</i> on Windows that lists the Note as supported
(v3  version 1.83 or 1.85 was the one I found - there doesn't seem  to
be any official home page or author, nor any sane version numbering; a
list        if       provided       e.g.       in       this        <a href="http://droidangel.blogspot.com/2011/05/odin-multi-downloader-flasher-program.html">overview</a>).
For  Linux,  <i>heimdall</i>  might  work (untested). To set  the  Note  into
download  mode,  use lower-vol + home + power and connect to USB.  For
more detail, check the XDA threads for your selected ROM.</p>

<p><i>Chainfire     KJ1     to    Chris_X    4lph4</i>     (see     <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1424401">XDA</a>).
As  we  now  have CFROOT/CWM available, this step no  longer  requires
Windows  and Odin. I repeated this step once to go to a newer ROM from
Chris,  currently  the v1.0.5 from early January, which is very  stable
(excluding  Google's  carefully  prepared pitfalls  concerning  shared
memory  and  system_server  vs app2sd). 

<p  class=anno>As of mid February, Chris is at v1.7.</p>

<p  class=anno>I  will  follow  Chris once in a  while  until  ICS  is
available  as a CFROOT/CWM supported ROM. In the long run, I'll expect
to end up on CM9 or newer.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>entering recovery: CWM application or upper vol + home + power
<li>using CWM to delete the contents of the cache partition and dalvik
cache  is  a  good  idea (the last adds about  15min  to  the  initial
boot).
<li>you may need to be selective in restoring titanium backups: browser 
and market may have different versions, so restoring user data may lead to force crashes.
This fragility is why Chris strongly requires full wipes as part of the install. Note
that restoring 300 user apps takes a whee bit of time.
<li>if you made a CWM Backup before flashing, do not use it as-is from CWM
recovery, as you'd restore the previous state and fully or partially undo
a successful flashing. Though it's perfect to undo a bad flashing or to go back
from testing another ROM.
<li>consider turning off OTA updates (Settings -&gt; About Phone -&gt; 
Software updates). While still a pretty rare event, Samsung is one of the select
few Android makers that actually publish ROM updates.
</ul>



<h4>Post-Flashing Checklist</H4>

<ul>
<li>check /data/system/uiderrors.txt (chown/chgrp as required as root or try CFROOT's
    fix permissions menu point in the recovery shell; uninstalling all affected apps is another
    option via market or <i>pm uninstall</i> in the shell)
<li>optional: consider doing an immediate fresh-custom-ROM-install backup, maybe 
    as simple as <i>tar cf /sdcard/data1.tar /data</i>, but don't overwrite any of your previous backups.
<li>optional: copy the backups from the PC back to the Note
<li>(selective) restore of applications (and possibly data) using <i>titanium backup</i>.
<li>use <i>zdbox</i> to move any apps on sdcard back to the phone (there are preference
    settings, but some apps always get installed on sdcard)
<li>check /data/system/uiderrors.txt again
<li>skim through the Android's settings menu:
<ul>
<li>fix language settings, reenable keyboards and assistance (if using e.g. <i>clip ninja</i>)
<li>test if application -&gt; USB debugging still enabled
<li>power settings
<li>phone menu: disable OTA software updates (this protects rooting/superuser in case of an 
    improbable OTA update by maker or provider)
<li>...
</ul>
<li>restore your widgets (e.g. <i>quick agenda</i>; <i>floatmemo</i>, <i>coolapps</i> and <i>smart task switcher</i> 
    might also be classified as offering widgets)
<li>check apps that should run on boot / have active schedules (in my case: <i>titanium backup</i>, <i>tasker</i>, 
    <i>lookout</i>, <i>LBE privacy guard</i>, <i>ring guard</i>, <i>smart task switcher</i>)
<li>check <i>terminal ide</i> and root access
<li>from the PC, check the SDK's <i>adb shell</i> access as well as ssh access via <i>sshdroid</i>
<li>check logcat in the shell (is there a need to run insmod /lib/modules/logger.ko or similar?)
<li>rerun sl4a installers (perl apk file is e.g. the installer/uninstaller for perl)
<li>restore your ring and notification tone settings
<li>check apps (e.g. by <i>titanium backup</i> or by ls /system/app) for applications to 
    disable (<i>titanium backup</i>: freeze)
<li>optional: restore your own modifications to the Android shell and to 
    the <i>terminal ide</i> environment (run /s/INSTALL from part two to recover Android shell 
    modifications, scripts, binaries and symlinks; if lost, do recover the contents of /s
    and the root account for <i>terminal ide</i> from backup. In my case /s should be a symlink
    pointing to /data/local/setup, which currently points to /mnt/sdcard/COMPACT/setup).
<li>optional: if already installed: check mc, bash, vi/vim in the shell and in <i>terminal ide</i>
<li>optional: check the availability and functionality of the chroot setup
</ul>

<p>Finally</p>
<ul>
<li>restore /etc/openvpn from the backup (for now, this is intentioanally skipped by INSTALL)
<li>check /data/system/uiderrors.txt again
<li>make  a new backup and copy that to the PC (not  replacing your old one from pre-flash)
</ul>


<h4>Software</h4>

<p>1. Nice to have market apps to improve on Android graphical offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>apg</i> (an Android frontend for pgp/gpg encrypted files)
<li><i>aspotcat</i>, <i>lookout</i> or <i>avast</i>, <i>lbe privacy guard</i> (security, permissions, receivers, intents)
<li><i>clipper</i>, <i>clip ninja</i>, <i>floatmemo</i> (without a window system, we need help to transfer data between apps)
<li><i>clocksync</i> (to keep your clock in sync with NTP)
<li><i>coolapps</i> (system load widget and much more)
<li><i>jota</i> (nice text editor)
<li><i>k9</i> (nice mailer)
<li><i>mobile odin</i> (custom ROM flasher, see also the <i>cwm</i> app, which should be part of the custom ROM)
<li><i>printbot</i>, <i>scanthing</i> (printing and scanning, with OCR by uploading to google docs; also consider 
    adding some simple office suite app (most also double as - usually slow - pdf readers)
<li><i>ring guard</i> (the Note's way better than the Milestone in this regard, but I still accidentally 
            manage to change ring tone loudness)
<li><i>smart taskswitcher</i>, <i>task manager</i>
<li><i>tasker</i> (programmable Android event handling, can substitute for cron, can turn on/off WLAN depending on location, etc)
<li><i>terminal emulator</i>
<li><i>zdbox</i> (task killing, moving apps from sdcard to phone)
</ul>

<p  class=anno>(voice recognition and more than word-level handwriting
recognition  aren't quite there yet in gingerbread; evernote  features
the  last  one, but the recognized text is inaccessible and only  used
for indexing/searching)</p>


<p>2. Required market apps for the rest of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>busybox installer</i> (from stericson, use /system/xbin as installation path)
<li><i>connectbot</i> (ssh app to connect to remote systems)
<li><i>file expert</i> or any other filemanager capable of accessing non-sdcard or root directories
<li><i>sshdroid</i> (permit incoming ssh connections, dropbear-based, also including ssh/scp)
<li><i>superuser</i> (usually part of the custom firmware: a fake su coupled 
       with popups to ask the user to accept/deny, and an editor for stored decisions about application root requests)
<li><i>terminal ide</i> (a pretty complete unix user space for the Android shell; works well even without root)
<li><i>titanium backup</i> (backup and restore; also offers dealing with offending firmware apps)
<li><i>xvnc</i> or <i>vnc viewer</i> (we use them in part 4)
<li>mostly optional: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">sl4a and perl</a> (perl/python/lua wrapper
    examples are available for use in the Android shell; some of my Android shell scripts may require perl)
</ul>

<p  class=anno>(there also are one or two apps that intend to simplify
the  creation  of  the chroot for sections 3 and 4 of this  article  -
search for linux installer on the market; usually either Ubuntu or DEBIAN)</p>


<p>3. PC applications</p>
<ul>
<li><i>adb</i> (in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk">Android SDK</a>, tools directory)
<li>(the initial flashing above required one-time use of <i>odin</i> or <i>heimdall</i>; <i>kies</i> 
    may or may not offer that feature, but according to most threads, <i>kies</i> is 
    one of those four letter words rather than a usable application)
</ul>


<p><b>Summary:</b>  By now you've a rooted Android device, seen a  few
XDA support threads as well as some checklists for use when reflashing
the ROM.</p>

<a name=shell></a>
<H3>Adding Unix Standards to the Android Shell</H3>

<p>Do run and setup each of <i>busybox installer</i>, <i>sshdroid</i>,
<i>terminal ide</i>, <i>titanium backup</i> and <i>superuser</i>. From
now on, I assume that</p>

<ul>
<li>you've a Linux PC available (if you want to look at the automation examples incl. nightly backup and monitoring)
<li>grep, sh, etc is available in /system/xbin (<i>stericson busybox installer</i>)
<li>running <i>su</i>, then <i>id</i> in <i>terminal ide</i> shows either root or the numerical id 0 (otherwise 
    verify <i>superuser</i>; note that the Android shell <i>su</i> is not the normal Linux <i>su</i>)
<li>you can run <i>shh root@&lt;WLAN IP of your device&gt;</i> to start an Android shell using the dropbear daemon (check <i>sshdroid</i>; 
    your public key goes to /data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/.ssh/authorized_keys)
</ul>

Further assumptions and settings of my setup (please also check in case of errors):
<ul>
<li>my hostname of the Note is note or note.compact: <i>hostname note; echo "127.0.0.1 note.compact note "$(getprop net.hostname)" localhost" >> /etc/hosts</i>
<li>DNS lookup should probably be provider-independent: 
   <i>(echo nameserver 8.8.8.8; echo nameserver 8.8.4.4) > /etc/resolv.conf</i> in case something queries /etc; 
   <i>for i in net.pdp0.dns1 net.eth0.dns1 net.dns1; do setprop $i 8.8.8.8; done</i> for anything using bionic or the
   Android framework.
<li>If you see a hardcoded WLAN IP of 192.168.2.114, please replace it with your own Note's WLAN IP. 
<li>If you see a hardcoded WLAN IP of 192.168.2.6 or the name anuurn: this refers to my Linux Box, please replace it with your IP on the WLAN.
<li>/s is a symlink to /mnt/sdcard/COMPACT/setup. /s/INSTALL is the script responsible
    installing my symlinks and scripts into the Android shell.
<li>system/xbin or just xbin is the directory containing most of my scripts, armel binaries and
    a DNS-resolving copy of <i>busybox</i>.
<li>/x will be the mountpoint of the chroot below. Inside, it is a symlink to the root of the chroot.
    If it is obvious, I shall omit the /x prefix. Thus /root and /home/jakobi with or without 
    leading slash are paths in the chroot. 
<li>/x/abin or just abin is the chroot directory used for chroot-specific glue scripts complementing 
    the scripts in system/xbin, many of which are usable also from within the chroot.
<li>the example home/jakobi/bin/shell/android.func defines some shell aliases to interact with the
    Note from a Linux box: inote, notescp, notessh
<li>of course, all of these paths are also valid inside the host-specific subdirectory in the tarball
</ul>

<p>Now that we've taken care of the basics and have access to a rooted
Note,  let's get to the more interesting parts of this article.</p>



<h4>Differences  from  a real Linux system</h4>

<p>libc and its most visible problem: Google reinvented an embedded small
libc  clone  by  the name of bionic, with together  with  the  Android
framework  implements  DNS in a non-standard way. This leads  to  some
confusion  in porting as whether to look at the output of setprop  and
make  quite a few code modifications or just look at the files in /etc
and  hope  that  something (the user...) keeps them in sync  with  the
framework's  properties (setprop/getprop shell command). For  busybox,
the  stericson  version you installed into /system/xbin does  use  DNS
properly,  while  the  versions from <i>sshdroid</i>  and  <i>terminal
ide</i>  do  not and only permit raw IP addresses. I defined an  alias
iresolver to reorder PATH to enable DNS-related shell commands.</p>

<p>Google   also   reinvented  the  wheel  with  logcat.  Again   with
interesting  effects:  they didn't mangle all parts of the kernel,  so
many  kernel messages never make it to logcat at all. Worse, there  is
no  syslog/klog,  and  messages at best can be seen for a  very  short
period  in a much too noise dmesg output. The lost messages include so
uninteresting topics such as logged packets from user-created iptables
rules.   However,  messages  about  filesystem  data  corruption   are
similarly mistreated. Which just happens to be a <b>severe reliability
issue</b>.  Note that there's nothing in a chroot that can work around
this problem.</p>

<p class=anno>(logcat use may require insmod /lib/modules/logger.ko)</p>

<p>Other   things  that  may  be  unavailable:  Shared  memory.  Again
improperly removed/unconfigured, leading to crashes and the X11 shared
memory  workaround  reported later on. NFS client or  server  support.
The ability to use swap space or swap to file.</p>

<p>The  low power portions of the Google patches neglects to  properly
fix   sleep.   So   without   active  wake_locks   to   avoid   system
suspend-to-ram,  even a one second sleep is completely unreliable  and
may  have  a duration of a few minutes. Large sleeps are affected  way
worse:  Sleeps  aren't ended when the system activates again  and  the
real  time  is  after the intended end of sleep. Thus  a  chroot  cron
becomes  pretty  much unusable without constantly  maintaining  active
wakelocks.    See    the   example   <i>system/xbin/WAKELOCK</i>    to
set/clear/list wake locks.</p>

<p  class=anno>(see e.g. <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/318611/">LWN:
Wakelocks and the embedded problem</a> - inconsiderate patches such as
these  with  heavy collaterate damage do have a hard time to  make  it
upstream into the Linux kernel sources)</p>



<h4>Notes on Functionality and Commands</h4>

<p>Editing  text:  a  simple vi clone is part of busybox, and  can  be
found  in /system/xbin, and as part of <i>sshdroid</i> and <i>terminal
ide</i>.  A real port of vim is available with <i>terminal ide</i>. On
the graphical side, consider <i>jota</i>.</p>

<p>I  found  a few working static armel binaries for bash, mc,  rsync,
strace,  tcpdump, and wget. They are included in the example files  in
system/xbin.  Bash and mc are also included with <i>terminal  ide</i>,
but  the terminal-ide mc version lacks sub-shell support. A simplified
wget is also part of busybox.</p>

<p>The shell: sh is part of both busybox and toolbox. As I've run into
a  slew of toolbox bugs, I'd suggest to use /system/xbin/sh. Or  bash,
as mentioned in the previous paragraph. (consider a symlink /bin/bash,
but it's probably better to avoid /bin/sh). Don't mix GNU programs and
busybox  programs within a single pipe hosted by busybox sh  (spurious
output write errors between pipe stages).</p>

<p>To  use  Perl  in the shell, see the system/xbin/perl  example  and
install      sl4a      and      the     perl     apk      from      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">Scripting Languages
for  Android</a>.  Python  and lua wrappers are also included,  but  I
don't  really use them. In case of <i>sl4a</i> crashes, uninstall  and
reinstall  the  crashing  language.  Consider  creating  the   symlink
/usr/bin/perl  and  adding  /usr/bin  to the  PATH  to  permit  normal
invocation.</p>

<p  class=anno>To use the Android GUI in say ssh scripts, you need the
access  data  from a running "host environment" like <i>sl4a</i>:  run
the  shell  in <i>sl4a</i> and redirect the output of set to  a  file.
Keep open <i>sl4a</i> and set suitable environment variables according
to  the captured output. Maybe also of interest/possibly working as  a
"host":  <i>tasker</i>  and  <i>taskbomb</i> with its  script  support
package (all 3 on market).</p>

<p class=anno>(in case you do not want sl4a: at the end of part 3, you
will  also  be able to alias <i>perl</i> to <i>x perl</i> and use  the
chroot's perl installation)</p>

<p>Script examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>CHROOT.run</i> (often aliased to x); starts a shell in the chroot or
    run chroot commands as part of a pipe. But more on this will
    have to wait until part 3.
<li><i>/s/INSTALL</i> (Android shell customization script: install and update 
    apps in /system/xbin, create links like /i and /e for the scards,
    /s, /t, ..., 
    add scripts to the Android boot process. The master copy of
    tarballs and scripts/configuration is also maintained in the
    subdirectories of /s)
<li><i>psg</i> is a <i>ps -ef|grep</i> style alias. It also offers to list
    non-standard jobs of interest, or to classify processes as kernel / Android 
    framework/Java / shell or chroot. As busybox doesn't implement ps -ef,
    the script uses busybox top as base.
<li><i>TOP</i> augments to output of TOP with various Android specific information
    from watching df, checking that interesting filesystems are still read-write,
    to battery status and cpu frequencies. No interactive top command keys possible.
<li><i>VPN*</i> are the openvpn setup scripts, see below.
<li><i>WAKELOCK</i> is a convenient wrapper used to setup/discard and list wake locks, 
    and used in many of the other scripts.
</ul>

<h4>Treasure Trove Terminal IDE</h4>

<p>(there's no need to use java and the ide to really profit from installing and using <i>terminal ide</i>)</p>

<p><i>terminal  ide</i>  aims to attempt to make standard  Unix  setup
available  to permit working with vim and java, thus the <i>IDE in the
terminal</i>  name. This provides the best working environment for the
Android shell outside of a chroot. It offers e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>bash (this lacks subshell/jobs support)
<li>busybox (though lacking DNS-resolving; see the iresolver function or
    temporarily prepend /system/xbin to the PATH)
<li>mc   (this lacks subshell support, consider running the 
   system/xbin/mc binary from the example files or the chroot's <i>x mc -a</i>.
<li>tmux (screen-style terminal multiplexer, configured to use CTRL-a as command key)
<li>vim (_the_ editor; way better than vi, and much better than the busybox vi subset)
</ul>

<p>With  some  coaxing in the form of custom profiles and  the  script
TERMIDE  (I  usually  alias it to t), the environment is  also  usable
outside   the   app,   e.g.   from  ssh  or   for   root.   See   both
data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/files/root                 and
data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/files.  The  example  profiles
will  also  clone two bash files from the chroot's root  account  into
data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/files/root   to   maintain   a
single  environment  inside  and  outside of the  chroot,  inside  the
<i>terminal  ide</i> app and outside, for both the <i>terminal ide</i>
user account or for root. Running the app is not required.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>a <i>terminal ide</i> bash may block attempts  to  run
    <i>mount  -oro,remount /system</i>. /s/INSTALL reliably triggers  that issue.
<li>injecting root profiles into files of another Android app in /data/data
    isn't the sanest thing to do. But it works, and the the 
    normal <i>terminal ide</i> user accounts needs similar settings anyway. Take
    a look in case of restoring with titanium backup, but other than mc 
    creating a new profile, nothing should happen. Wrt security, the Android
    setup is single-user in the first place, abusing id's for the purpose
    of isolating apps against each other. Given that we need to
    run <i>terminal ide</i> binaries as root anyway, there's no additional risk to consider.
<li>a fully configured vim with syntax highlighting might hang for when
    the sdcard is busy with heavy writing. For tiny edits,
    just ssh on the machine and use the busybox version.
<li>the app also offeres two full keyboard layout modes. However 
    e.g. CTRL isn't accepted by other apps (including all vnc apps).
    There is also a bug that only affects search and the default
    browser, which don't accept return key as 'Go' - mobile firefox
    and the other apps work fine (work-around: temporarily switch back
    to the Samsung keyboard).
</ul>



<p><b>Errata: Terminal IDE screenshot?</b></p>

<h4>Networking</h4>

<p>Browsing:  some  providers  like to mangle httml pages  or  provide
different  resolution  images and embed extra javascript in pages.  In
case  of the German Telekom, most of this nonsense can be disabled  by
<a href="http://speed.telekom.de/laptop_confirmation.php?u=">speed.telekom.de/laptop_confirmation.php?u=</a>.
This  behaviour  was questionable when it started and with  increasing
network  speed  and display sizes, it doesn't get more  reasonable  at
all.</p>

<p>Using   ssh:   Ssh-client  and  scp  can  be  found  as   part   of
<i>sshdroid</i> including sftp server and scp. Another copy is offered
by   <i>terminal   ide</i>.   A  real  openssh  build   is   part   of
<i>sshtunnel</i>,  also  named  sshtunnel. As  Android  app,  consider
<i>connectbot</i>.  Note  that I was unable to trivially port  an  old
ssh-based  tunnel trick of mine, as some ssh options are not supported
by any of these.</p>

<p>Using   sshd:  As  ssh-server  I  use  dropbear  as   provided   by
<i>sshdroid</i> (<i>terminal ide</i> again provides a second copy) and
only  rarely run a second sshd -p <portnumber> on an alternate port in
the         chroot.         See         the         profile         in
data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid.  Adding  keys with the  GUI
didn't  always  work,  so place them in  home/.ssh/authorized_keys  in
above directory.</p>

<p>Using  socks:  <i>proxydroid</i>,  <i>sshtunnel</i>  and   <i>orbot
(TOR)</i>-  iptables-based  forwarding  of http/https  requests  to  a
server-based  based socks daemon. If you want to setup your own  socks
daemon,  take  a look at the hpsockd.conf in the examples  (as  tested
once on Ubuntu 10.4).</p>

<p><b>ERRATA: add hpsockd.conf to examples</b></p>

<p>Iptables  is  hopefully part of your custom ROM. Iptables  is  also
part  of <i>proxydroid</i>, <i>sshtunnel</i> and <i>orbot</i> packages
from  market. <i>lbe privacy guard</i> or any of the personal firewall
tools should also contain or offer to install a copy iptables.</p>

<p>Rsync:  I've  stumbled  upon  a static  compile  (included  in  the
examples)   which  is  as  simple  to  use  as  <i>rsync  -a  --delete
root@note:/DIR  /HOSTDIR</i>.  For  a  backup  solution,  check   e.g.
rsync-backup.  Some  of  the  rsync-related market  apps  should  also
provide suitable rsync binaries.</p>

<p  class=anno>I  think  that  for now I will want to  fall  short  of
providing  the  promised  automated nightly backup  solution  (if  you
silently  add  a  'simple'  in there). In the meantime,  the  files  I
actually  use  in my backup are part of the example files.  My  backup
setup  is  bit  older  than  rsync-backup  and  centers  on  filtering
filelists.  As  invoked for the Note, it uses also rsync for copy  and
cleanup  of removed files, and it also keeps numbered daily/weekly/...
snapshots.              Execution             starts              with
home/jakobi/bin/xfer_backup.wrapper.anuurn.local,  which is invoked by
a  nightly  root cron job (ensure that <i>titanium backup</i>  on  the
Note  is finished first). Furthermore check the copied titanium backup
location  on  the  host  after  the  first  run  -  I  initially  used
/mnt/sdcard/external_sd/BAK,   however   a  directory  like   BAK   is
automatically excluded in my setup...</p>

<p>Using  a  VPN: OpenVPN and tun.ko is hopefully already part of  the
custom  ROM (or in case of tun.ko optionally also a part of the kernel
- otherwise add a insmod /lib/modules/tun.ko or similar; there also is
a  <i>tun.ko  installer</i>  on the market as well  as  an  <i>openvpn
installer</i>).  The  example  files  show  a  working   shared-secret
openvpn-pair example:

<ul>
<li>system/xbin/VPN* (with VPN to start the VPN, VPN-ALL to tunnel all
    traffic over the VPN including internet traffic and VPN-NONE for the
    opposite. To end the session, run VPN-NONE and maybe pkill openvpn).
<li>the etc/openvpn files for both the Linux host and the Note (/etc/vpn is NOT handled by INSTALL)
<li>see also the settings menu, which offers additional VPN options.
</ul>


<p><b>ERRATA: w/o jump</b></p>

<p>Some  graphical apps using VNC/RDP to view remote computers:  there
are  various  VNC  apps available, including  <i>vnc  viewer</i>,  and
<i>Pocketcloud</i>.  For  the  opposite direction, to  view  the  Note
desktop   using   VNC,   consider  <i>androidVNC</i>.</p>

<p  class=anno>(the Note's resolution is great, but my eye isn't  upto
to  the  Note's  300dpi,  so vnc use requires  zooming.  There's  also
a multihead  issue: no vnc app was up to deal with a multihead  display
of  two different sized monitors -&gt; run a a (smaller) vncserver  on
the remote host)</p>

<p>There's  also <i>Xvnc</i> which combines a vnc viewer hardwired  to
connect  to  a  locally running vnc server which acts  as  X11  server
(armel  binaries  included). If you've space issues when creating  the
chroot  in part 4, Xvnc is very convenient to skip installing most  of
X11  inside  the  chroot  -  merely  run  <i>aptitude  install   xterm
icewm</i>.</p>

<p>As  we install a chroot soon, I'm not covering graphical apps  that
access  remote  files  or offer access to remote files.  As  for  NFS,
without  kernel support, you cannot neither access NFS files nor offer
them.</p>

<p  class=anno>Unless you have access to a Linux box elsewhere and run
fuse sshfs in the direction you want to: The Linux box can then either
offer  the  Note's files per NFS or forward contents of NFS mounts  to
the  Note  (chroot  required  for  this  direction;  see  the  example
abin/SSHFS script later on).</p>

<p>For connecting to a WLAN and AP mode (WLAN tethering), just use the
settings  menu on the Note and e.g. network manager on the Linux  box.
For  tethering via USB, connect the Note and select USB tethering.  On
the  Linux box run <i>modprobe usbnet</i>, maybe also  <i>dhclient</i>
and  have a look at usb0. I didn't test inverse tethering (making  the
Note  use the Linux Box's connection to the internet), but on a  short
search  I found 11 pretty dissimilar sketches from using ppp or ssh or
adb with portforwarding to bridging.</p>

<p>Network security</p>
<ul>
<li>Antivirus  is a prime requirement. <i>avast</i> and  <i>lookout</i> on
the graphical app side sound sane and add some device-location and anti-theft features.
<li><i>Personal  firewalls</i> or rather <i>iptables-based outbound packet filters</i>
control outbound packages and are used to augment (<i>LBE  privacy  guard</i>)  or 
substitute  for  actual application  permission management.  Some  antivirus  apps
also include  this  feature  when running on a rooted Note (<i>avast</i>). Note
that this is only slightly more capable than your ordinary Windows personal firewall - 
even something as basic as a mere DNS name lookup can leak arbitrary information to a
selected target host. "Personal firewalls" are also not quite the right place 
to block apps for ideas like battery saving.
<li><i>system/xbin/FW</i>: I didn't find any <b>real firewall</b> that deals with inbound packages.
There are some inbound call and sms blockers, but one of the real basics of
network security doesn't seem to exist for Google and every Android developper.
See system/xbin/FW for a script to create and destroy a firewall. It is loosely
based on the rules as created by ufw on an Ubuntu box. Note that we cannot
use syslog for logging, so for rule testing, you need to run <i>dmesg|grep ...</i>
to see output for logged packets.
</ul>



<p><b>Summary:</b>  By  now we have a somewhat usable  and  moderately
comfortable  Android  shell.  We  have basic  networking  commands  to
connect  remote  servers and we we can run perl scripts.  An  external
host  can  be used to run shell commands on the Note or run  rsync  to
create  a  file  backup of the Note. We also have seen  an  automation
example consisting of a remote triggered backup. You also have a real
Linux networking setup and access to a real classic inbound firewall (FW).</p>

<H3>CHROOT and Turning the Android into a First Class LAN Citizen</H3>


<p>First let me start by pointing back to the warning against bad flash.</p>



<h4>Setting up the filesystems</h4>

<p>Let  us  create  a  SSD-style 4MB-aligned  partitioning  scheme  by
starting  the first partition at 8192 and have all partitions start at
sector   numbers  divisible  by  8192  (that  might  offer  a   slight
improvement  also with sdcard; optional).</p>

<p>Sizing:  For a basic desktop install plus build-essentials  install
and  some file serving, you need about 3.5GB + 2GB to install. A  rule
of  thumb  might  be to clean /var, /tmp and run aptitude  clean,  and
double  that size to add some reserve to permit upgrades, that is  for
me   at  least  7GB.  Without  any  desktop  task,  you  should  still
comfortably  fit  in  in a slightly less-than-4GB  file  container  on
either  the  internal  or external sdcard, however the  required  loop
mount  adds some overhead and I already had some data loss on the  old
external  sdcard, so I'd argue for a direct ext4 setup.</p>

<p>Put  the  sdcard to use in a card reader on your  Linux  box  and
umount any automatically mounted filesystems from the sdcard. Then run
fdisk and create the filesystems.</p>

<p class=anno>(the commands are pasted from my notes, I shouldn't have
changed much afterwards; any interesting changes should be part of the
CHROOT.mount  script,  which  mirrors  some  of  the  post-debootstrap
preparations like the mount -obind commands below)</p>

<h4>Debootstrap</h4>

<p>Run  stage  1  still on the Linux Box and copy the results  to  the
chroot  filesystem.  Both  stable (squeeze) and testing  (wheezy)  are
suitable for use as chroot.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>run mount and check the mount options for the chroot filesystem: it
should be something along the lines of rw,noatime,barrier=1,data=ordered; otherwise 
change CHROOT.mount or use tune2fs to add default mount options.
<li>Android doesn't supply a working fsck for ext4, see system/xbin/CHROOT.fsck for an example work-around.
<li>if the bluez packages is still broken and insists on a running udevd, just remove 
   /var/lib/dpkg/info/bluez.postinst and run dpkg --configure --all.
<li>mono is not needed, furthermore there were some packaging errors. Uninstall with some effort: 
<i>aptitude install gnote; 
dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/libglib2.0-cil_2.12.10-3_armel.deb;
dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/libgtk2.0-cil_2.12.10-3_armel.deb;
aptitude purge libdbus-glib1.0-cil libdbus1.0-cil libgconf2.0-cil
 libglib2.0-cil libgmime2.4-cil libgtk2.0-cil tomboy libmono-addins-gui0.2-cil 
libmono-addins0.2-cil libmono-i18n-west4.0-cil libmono-i18n4.0-cil libmono-posix4.0-cil
 libmono-sharpzip4.84-cil libmono-system-configuration4.0-cil libmono-system-core4.0-cil
 libmono-system-drawing4.0-cil libmono-system4.0-cil mono-gac mono-runtime; 
aptitude purge mono-runtime libmono-system4.0-cil</i>
<li>other candidates for removal: wicd (wireless connection manager) and bluetooth
    (I've not tested to run bluez &amp; friends from the chroot; for now I do
    the network management outside of the chroot excluding just ip route or iptables,
    which I occasionally also call from within; note that I even use things like
    <i>openvpn</i> outside of the chroot in the Android shell)
<li>on removing apps, run deborphan and consider uninstalling the listed files,
    then start aptitude and press 'g' and look if aptitude suggests additional
    removals from the previously automatically installed packages. Keep what you
    still use (e.g. press i/m) and continue to remove the rest.
<li>to add checksums of installed files (though not verifying permissions), install debsums
    and run debsums_init; this helps in checking for overwritten or corrupted package files.
</ul>



<h4>Some customization</H4>



<p>While the scripts in system/xbin are for the outside Android shell,
the  abin  directory in the chroot in the example files contains  some
in-chroot  glue.  So  we  there are the  chroot  starting  scripts  in
system/xbin  which  often call scripts by the same name in  abin  once
inside  the  chroot.  The abin directory in the chroot  also  contains
other  glue scripts, like e.g. CHECK (monitoring), SSHFS (remote  file
access) and the CRON* files (enable some basic cron-style scripts that
schedule  somewhat sanely despite unreliable sleep in Android kernels.
The CHROOT scripts in detail:</p>


<ul>
<li>CHROOT.available prints the mount state of the chroot
<li>CHROOT.fsck is a mere example on how to fsck the chroot from
    within, as the Note doesn't contain an external fsck for ext4,
    despite using ext4 filesystems for the Android data.
<li>CHROOT.mount mounts all filesystems for the chroot (basically it
    runs the mount statements you already saw above when using the chroot
    for the first time)
<li><b>CHROOT.run</b> either starts a shell in the chroot or runs a command
    and returns the command's return code. It can be used transparently 
    as part of a pipe, and it will try hard to properly deal with outside
    full or partial filenames (mounts if necessary)
<li>CHROOT.start starts cron, dbus and a second sshd (mounts if necessary)
<li>CHROOT.startx calls CHROOT.start, otherwise reserved, as I currently
    to aliases like ivnc to start X11 (mounts if necessary)
<li>CHROOT.stop only stops the services started by CHROOT.start.
<li>CHROOT.umount first calls abin/CHROOT.umount to umount remote 
    filesystems and to stop dbus/cron. The script then tries to
    umount all filesystems of the chroot. Using the -k option 
    attempts a second umount after trying to kill processes 
    using the mountpoint. Ugly, brutal and unreliable. Invoked multiple
    times with -k however, it will succeed.
<li>CHROOTED tests if a process is already running in the chroot.
</ul>

<p  class=anno>(I  still  hold  some  hope  of  never  having  to  fix
CHROOT.umount due to never using it again :))</p>



<p>Root  account:  As  I  didn't want to maintain  umpteen  copies  of
profiles,  I keep my own stuff in root/.bash{_aliases,rc}.pj and  just
add  suitable sourcing or updating statements to the other files. That
way,  user accounts and <i>terminal ide</i> share this master copy  to
provide  their  own  environment. The profiles set a sane  prompt  and
window  title  providing  port/pty/user/directory  information,   plus
return  code  in  case  of PS1. They also contain  aliases  to  shadow
updatedb/locate  with a grep in the nightly generated filelists of the
backup. Note that this requires a not that secure chmod 711 on /root -
the  clean  way would have been to put the config files to share  into
abin  and  just source them as everyone else does. Again you can  find
copies of these files in the example tarball.</p>

<p>In  setting  up non-system user accounts, you do not want  to  trip
over  Android  ID's. I changed /etc/login.def to use 20000 instead  of
1000  for the values of UID_MIN, GID_MIN. In /etc/adduser.conf, change
FIRST_UID and FISRT_GID similarly. Add android_network:x:3003:USERNAME
to  /etc/group and fix gshadow accordingly. 3003 is the public  secret
number  for  the  group permitting network access. A  possible  search
keyword is ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK.</p>

<p>Escaping the chroot can be done by ssh to localhost, as shown below
in  the example using the chroot's host key. If you use ssh-agent with
other   passphrase-protected  keys,  invoke  it  as   <i>ssh-agent   >
~/.ssh/env.$(hostname)</i>.</p>

<pre>
cd /root/.ssh
ln -s /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key id_rsa
ln -s /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub id_rsa.pub
cd /data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/dropbear
ln -s /system/xbin/CHROOT.run x
cd ../home/.ssh
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys
# check permission and owner
ls -l authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>Umlauts  and  locale settings are a bit surprising, as  I  expected
full  utf8 support everywhere on the Android by default. Umlauts  seem
properly displayed, on delete however they're appear as multiple chars
in the Android shell. I still need to really run DEBIAN as more than a
server  system  to get a better grip on where and what packages  offer
locales,  as  I didn't find e.g. en_US.UTF8. For the time  being,  the
sanest  setting is LANG=C.UTF-8, plus a paranoid LC_COLLATE=C, as this
repairs deletion on ssh logins to the chroot.</p>



<H4>Overview of Services and an Automation Example</h4>

<p>Some  applications  require  a  running  dbus:  <i>/etc/init.d/dbus
start</i>. For me, I collect the usual low-weight services to start in
abin/CHROOT.start, but I rarely use it.</p>

<p>Terminal  multiplexing:  screen  is  broken and  hangs  on  detach,
however tmux is working properly. See /root/.tmux.conf for setting
the command key to CTRL-a like with screen.</p>

<p>Virtualization,  e.g. lxc: mostly unsupported (bridging might  also
be unsupported, depending on the kernel).</p>

<p>Basic  cron  services  are  problematic, as  sleep  is  unreliable.
abin/CRON* offers an example setup to to cope with this situation. The
15min  job  contains  code to catch missed runs of  the  slower  shell
scripts  and  tries to resynchronize them with their  original  window
when  delayed.  All  you  need to do is  invoking  x  /abin/CRON.15min
remotely  or with <i>tasker</i> or from multiple invocation sources at
once  (the  jobs  maintain suitable locking). This  example  might  be
extended  with anacron and more of the actual cron jobs configured  in
/etc.  The abin/CRON.15min script is currently run by remote root cron
every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>In  my  case  I've instead added a repeated short  period  WAKELOCK
invocation  to  the root cronjob on my Linux box. Thus  sleep  becomes
reliable  in  my home WLAN and the ordinary cron (if started) can  run
normally  during  the night. However this also implies that not  using
the CPU by sleeping now costs extra battery, as the Note can no longer
do a quick automatic suspend-to-RAM.</p>

<p>Monitoring:  the  example  abin/CHECK  offers  a  basic  monitoring
script,  which can be run by ssh and evaluated remotely (see the  root
cronjob and watch_delta; run every 15 minutes).</p>

<p>Mail  notification and forwarding: The sendmail service is provided
by  exim4.  Without  a  setup, exim4 places all  local  email  in  the
/var/mail/mail  spool  file.  abin/CHECK reports  available  mail,  as
should  TOP. Again have a look at the root cronjob file for an example
to  forward  this chroot-local mail to my account on the remote  Linux
box  (run every 15 minutes). As I don't want a real mail configuration
in a chroot, that's good enough for me.</p>

<p>Sending and receiving mail can still be done inside the chroot with
e.g.  mutt by going directly to the remote imap/pop/sendmail  servers,
without  relying  on  a local sendmail. The example  files  contain  a
cut-down  mutt  setup as part of my normal user account in the  chroot
(host.note/x/home/jakobi/.mutt).  There's  also a wrapper in  bin/mutt
that  I use to switch profiles and sender account according to  folder
contents,  which you can ignore as long as you use only a single  mail
account or define macros to switch accounts.</p>

<p>Encryption:  For now I only use <i>apg</i> on the Android side  and
gpg  in the chroot for a couple of files. This is more than enough  to
use  vim  to  decrypt a file with some web forum  passwords.  I  would
sugggest  to  only  edit  this  file  on  your  Linux  box  to   avoid
synchronization  issues,  as  patch or unison aren't able  to  analyze
changes within the file.</p>

<p><b>ERRATA: Demonstrate an encrypted loop mount?</b></p>

<p>For   backup   and  synchronization,  revisit  the   example   file
xfer_backup.wrapper.anuurn.local and the nightly backup job invoked by
remote  root cron. Besides running the list-based rsync, it also  runs
home/jakobi/bin/ct_note.update-copies                              and
home/jakobi/bin/ct_note.update-unison.  The  first clones a subset  of
the  my  home  directory onto Note, the second synchronizes  a  folder
tree,  with one layer also following symlinks, both only run when  the
chroot  is  mounted.  As the Ubuntu 10.4 version was  too  ancient,  I
installed  a  new  build in /usr/local/bin on the  Linux  box.  Remote
invocation  is  as  simple as <i>DISPLAY= unison  /data/unison  -batch
-auto -servercmd "x unison" ssh://note//data/unison</i></p>

<p>Using  sshd:  I'm  still using <i>sshdroid</i>'s  dropbear  as  the
primary  ssh daemon, dealing with backup traffic, and everything.  The
chroot  from  the Linux box by running <i>ssh root@note x  COMMAND</i>
(e.g.  done  by  unison;  rsync dislikes the space  in  'remote  rsync
command   names'   and  requires  the  chroot-rsync  dummy   file   in
sshdroid/dropbear).   If   you  need  a  real  sshd  without   similar
work-around,  just  run  <i>sshd  -p PORT  &amp;</i>  in  the  chroot,
possibly also stopping sshdroid. If you really want to, you can add it
to  system/etc/init.d/S99zz_compact_jobs  to  start  at  boot  of  the
Note.</p>

<p>Accessing remote filesystems: Have a look at the example abin/SSHFS
containing simple mount/umount commands to permit access to files on a
remote Linux box. This requires the fuse sshfs package and even offers
access  to anything mounted on the remote Linux box. SSHFS is intended
to  also  deal with SMB, and NFS (if the kernel permits), but this  is
not yet tested.</p>

<p>File serving: Use the usual culprits of ftp, apache and samba as on
any  Linux  box. Don't forget to edit and rerun FW on if you  need  to
open ports in the firewall.</p>


<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>in  the  long  run, this  chroot  setup  is  still  not
comparable  to a native install, that can replace and update the Linux
kernel  as  part of the normal package maintenance. We still  have  to
rely  on  availability of stock kernels as part of the custom ROM,  as
it's  unlikely that some of the device blobs will be availble with new
kernels.  Furthermore,  vulnerabilities of the outside  Android  still
apply  and  will  only get worse when the device is obsoleted  by  the
maker  (at least Samsung doesn't do this before release to the market,
like some other makers).
<li>a newer architecture called <b>armhf</b> is being in the works at 
DEBIAN and Ubuntu, which introduces support for more modern CPU features 
and improves FPU support. However the suggested repositories for armhf failed
already in stage one of debootstrap in early January. 
This should prove interesting  in the medium term. When it's entered 'testing', 
just  replace <i>armel</i> with <i>armhf</i> and recreate the chroot. 
<li>swap would be a good idea to add with a suitable swappiness  setting
to reserve swap as a last resort, as a notifier-by-pain to delay the 
 out-of-memory-killer (though I  didn't meet oom during any tests 
including X11 and LibreOffice).  I'd advise to change swappiness to
make the kernel prefer RAM to swap as long as possible: cheap flash may
also have a questionable flash translation layer (if at all), and swap with
randomly distributed write hotspots is the worst possible load to balance, 
way worse than FAT (one hotspot at the beginning), ext4 with an ordinary 
Linux install (with or without journal) or database files, with database
transaction logs being the most harmless use of all).
</ul>

<p class=anno>(as of 20120214
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatChroot">wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatChroot</a>
suggests the standard repositories for non-source packages, using 'sid' and 'unreleased'. If FPU support
is indeed the only change, after the final backup and before removing the contents of the chroot, it is
tempting to just change the architecture in the apt/sources.list and check what happens. Maybe with first
repeating the debootstrap steps, and then restoring the old /var and most of /etc. 
Do check the release notes first, there might even be a supported armel to armhf upgrading path for installations :))
 </p>

<p><b>Summary:</b>  By  now we have a DEBIAN chroot and can access  it
from   the   Android  shell  interactively  or  as  part  of  a   pipe
(system/xbin/CHROOT.run  aka  x). You are also able to  access  remote
files  using  everything  but  NFS (see the  abin/SSHFS  example).  We
extended the remote automation with limited email checking, monitoring
and folder synchronization.</p>

<a name=vnc></a>
<H3>Desktop and X11</H3>



<H4>VNC Viewers</H4>

<p>The  idea  of VNC is to split X11 into the server  component  (e.g.
tightvncserver)  and  a  separate,  remote  display  component   (e.g.
vncviewer),  which just exchanging compressed graphic data between the
two  parts.  Comparing  local  VNC  to using  a  remote  X11  display,
transmitting  graphic data is usually less efficient than other  types
of  data, but eliminating remote call / round trips to the X11  server
by  the client strips all remote call latency, which in itself already
makes  vnc very interesting for non-LAN situations.</p>

<p>For  the  chroot we ignore issues other than 2d display,  keyboard,
mouse.  If you want audio, consider a network-capable audio setup like
pulseaudio,  or have a look at sl4a, where your might send intents  to
the  Android  framework. If device access isn't blocked by  something,
you could also try accessing the device directly. I also ignore flash;
if you need it w/o audio in the chroot, consider e.g. gnash. But adobe
itself nowadays seems pretty ambivalent towards use of flash. The idea
behind  RDP is similar, and some viewers support both protocols, but I
didn't check for server components usable in a chroot.</p>

<p>A selection of vnc viewer components</p>
<ul>
<li><i>vncviewer</i> - Android app classic (there are multiple other viewers)
<li><i>xvnc</i> - Android app, hardcoded to use its own vncserver
                  installed outside the chroot (useful to reduce the chroot size)
<li>there is also tightvncviewer - the default vncviewer inside the chroot,
    but I'd suggest use with only small remote vnc server displays, as
    we'd need a local vncserver or a remote X11 display (if that actually
    works)
</ul>

<p>A selection of vnc server components</p>
<ul>
<li><i>xvnc</i> - the vncserver component is accessible to localhost,
    so use <i>vncviewer localhost:0 -via root@note</i> or establish a 
    port forwarding ssh tunnel and then connect using localhost:
    <i>ssh -L 5909:localhost:5900 -N -f root@note; vncviewer :9</i>.
    For more information, see <a href="http://theqvd.com/trac/wiki/AndroidX11Server">theqvd.com/trac/wiki/AndroidX11Server</a> (the vnc password cannot be changed yet in the Android viewer).
<li><i>tightvncserver</i> - the default vncserver inside the chroot.
</ul>

<p  class=anno>(there are also some interesting ideas on VNC abuse for
e.g.  remote  input devices, most of which seem to work fine at  least
for  single head displays. E.g. Android as mouse-cum-touchpad or media
remote.   There   is  also  in  opposite  direction  an   app   called
<i>androidvnc</i>    that    exports   the   Android    display    to
vncviewers.)</p>



<h4>Memories</h4>

<p>My current setup reliably "remove-battery"-crashes the Note as soon
as  I use X. I think its a kernel issue, assuming that Google  somehow
messed  up in crippling or deconfiguring shared memory. As workaround,
I  can only offer to actually also enforce zero values for all  shared
memory  settings. This hack is part of the ivnc / ivncapp functions in
the  root bash setup included in the example files. Applications  that
normally  use but don't rely on shared memory, will run a bit  slower.
Applications   like  chromium-browser  will  fail  when   using   this
trick.</p>

<pre>
# test if you crash or if you can get by without
# this ugly trick, in which case don't forget to
# remove it from the ivnc* functions in 
# /root/.bash_aliases.pj

for i in /proc/sys/kernel/shm*;
do
   echo 0 | sudo tee -a $i > /dev/null;
done;
</pre>

<p>Initially,  I  suspected free memory issues, but neither watch  -n1
cat  /proc/meminfo  nor strace indicated anything interesting. If  you
run  into  a  real memory-issue, these are the values I  played  with:
<i>sysctl   -w   vm.min_free_kbytes=80000</i>  or   <i>sync;sleep   2;
/sbin/sysctl  vm.drop_caches=3</i>,  if you have swap,  also  consider
swappiness  and as a last resort, you can play with  /proc/PID/oom_adj
or  setting  up  limits  using  cgroups  (search  wrapcgroup  in   the
script-archive).  Returning  to  my  memory suspicion,  I  have  about
300-350M  free  before  X, which is enough for  a  vncserver,  xterms,
firefox  3.5  and  LibreOffice with icewm, and still leaves  room  for
buffers  and  caches.  In testing, I never had into  an  out-of-memory
situation.</p>

<p>Still,  being able to add swap space (the second reserved partition
above;  or just a swap file) would be nice, but my current kernel does
permit  swap. The fast internal flash would be tempting. But I'm a bit
sceptical  and  thus would only suggest to use the removable  external
flash,  with a swappiness setting to make swap a real last resort  for
the  kernel  just before invoking the out-of-memory-killer.  I  assume
that  swap  write  access patterns will have random,  but  very  heavy
hotspots,  which  would be the worst possible pattern for testing  the
implementation  quality of a only possibly existing flash  translation
layer on sdcards. Given my experiences with bad flash and the frequent
firmware  updates  as  observed for better SSD  devices  from  quality
vendors  in the last few years (indicating firmware fixes to also  the
FTL), I'll for now stick to my paranoia. Don't argue with database use
of  flash - as e.g. transaction logs are the most friendly  sequential
access  pattern  there  is, that is, they do not stress nor  need  the
flash FTL at all.</p>



<h4>Testing X</h4>

<p>For  starters, try running xterm on the Note and display the window
on your Linux box: e.g. <i>DISPLAY=&lt;REMOTEDISPLAY&gt; xterm</i>. To
work,  the  X-server must list to tcp and permit  connections  (Ubuntu
doesn't  by  default). You may need to run xauth on the Linux box  and
copy  the values of the current cookie to the chroot by running  xauth
add  &lt;REMOTEDISPLAY&gt; MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 &lt;COOKIE&gt;. For this
quick  test  consider  to  temporarily turn off  the  firewall:  <i>FW
off</i>  on  the Android and maybe add an exception on the  Linux  box
(e.g.  man ufw on Ubuntu). Don't forget to reactivate both  host-based
firewalls.</p>

<p>If  you've started a second sshd in the chroot (say port 1234), you
can also run <i>ssh -p 1234 root@note -Y ...</i>, which should include
the  xauth invocation (in contrast to -X) and shouldn't AFAIR  require
the  X server to listen to tcp. Ssh tunneling also avoids the X issues
from above.</p>

<p>Now invoke vncserver inside the chroot by running the ivnc function
as  provided in root/.bash_aliases.pj in the examples. Define some vnc
password.  Run  <i>echo $DISPLAY</i>. Switch to the Linux Box and  run
<i>vncviewer &lt;EXACT_VALUE_FROM_ECHO&gt; -via root@note</i>. If you
don't have tightvncviewer, you need to use ssh with port forwarding.
Assuming that the echo returned localhost:4, you'd say
<i>ssh -L 5909:localhost:5904 -N -f root@note; vncviewer :9</i>.
We do not collide with the firewall, as we are using ssh.</p>

<p>As final test, run your vncviewer app on the Android and connect to
the  vncserver  in  the  chroot. Using Xvnc is  identical,  but  skips
configuring  the  connection in the app and explicitely  starting  the
vncserver in the chroot. Use the ivncapp alias after starting X within
Xvnc.</p>

<p>You  can  use  the file ~/.vnc/xstartup to run  commands  like  the
window  manager  automatically on starting the vncserver. In  case  of
troubles, chmod 755 ~/.vnc/xstartup might be required. A small example
is the following:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
icewm &amp;
sleep 2; xsetroot -solid black; xterm &amp;
/etc/X11/Xsession
</pre>

<p>A  final problem concerns pasting between vncviewer and X11 apps on
the  Linux  box when running Ubuntu 10.4, Gnome and urxvt. The  normal
suggestion  in  case  of  problems  is  to  run  <i>autocutsel</i>  to
synchronize  clipboards,  cutbuffers  and selections. My  terminal  of
choice  urxvt  however  is even more oldfashioned and  selective  than
xterm in accepting input for paste. Now something from Gnome - which I
couldn't  track  down  - does partially mangle the  primary  selection
within  the  first  .5s after autocutsel does its work,  resulting  in
urxvt  to be unable to paste. Work-around: grep the autocutsel source,
and  add  a  system()  after copying to the buffer,  invoking  only  a
'useless use of cat', a sleepy one at that: <i>sleep 0.6;xsel -op|xsel
-ip</i>.</p>



<h4>DEBIAN X11 Applications</h4>

<p>Successfully tested applications</p>
<ul>
<li>twm, icewm, openbox, lxsession (window managers and graphical environments; 
   I selected a naked icewm as the most usable of the bunch)
<li>firefox aka iceweasel (browser; from stable, version 3.5)
<li>midori, uzbl, (browsers; also kazehakase, galeon, epiphany-browser)
<li>konqueror, rekonq
<li>gvim, kwrite, LibreOffice aka OpenOffice
<li>xterm
</ul>

<p>Fails: These applications either require shared memory or some daemons
which I did not start or cannot easily start (hald or udevd)</p>
<ul>
<li>gnome-session, start-kde
<li>firefox aka iceweasel (from testing/sid; but this might also be a porting issue)
</ul>

<p>The  described setup with a small window manager like icewm permits
normal  LibreOffice  text  editing,  programming  or  some  light  web
browsing,   even   without  swap:  I've  usually  beyond  350MB   free
(free+buffers+cache)  before starting X, which is enough for X11, some
xterms, firefox and LibreOffice.</p>

<p>The speed with the current kernel/gingerbread is sufficient even if
only  ever using a single CPU. Speed however suffers and I  experience
short  hangs  during  heavy  writes  to  flash.  Especially  a   fully
configured  vim  with syntax highlighting will hang a bit,  while  the
simple busybox vi outside the chroot is unaffected. Even running huge
resolutions like <i>vncserver -geometry 1920x1600</i> did work without
issues, albeit slowly due the generated network traffic over ssh.</p>

<p>When encountering the firefox problem, I switched the chroot from a
pure  testing aka wheezy setup to a mixed setup with apt pinning,  see
etc/apt/sources.list   and   etc/apt/preferences.d/personal   in   the
examples. To install a package in the mixed setup:</p>
 
<pre>
apt-get install &lt;package&gt;/unstable    # prefer testing for resolution  
apt-get -t unstable install &lt;package&gt; # use unstable for resolution
# afterwards consider pinning the package to a specific release in 
# /etc/apt/preferences.d/*
</pre>

<p><b>ERRATA: check availability of sources.list and preferences?</b></p>



<p><b>Summary:</b> This concludes the series and by now you can use an
arbitrary  PC's  vncviewer or putty/ssh setup to connect to your  NOTE
and work locally on your Note in addition to using the Note to copy or
serve  files  to the PC. The 1GB memory size of the Note permits  also
use   of  X11  apps  including  Firefox   or   LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

<p>Excluding  only  the size of the display, the Note already has  the
capabilities  of  newer tablets as well as those of laptops,  with  at
most a little bit of DEBIAN help.</p>
