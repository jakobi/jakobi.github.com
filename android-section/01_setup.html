<p>Also                  see                  the                   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/android">Android
directory  of  the  script-archive</a>.</p>

<p>Besides  some scripts, this directory contains a one-time  snapshot
of  my working android environment intended to complement the articles
below. </p>

<p>The snapshot contains scripts for android unix-side userspace,
a  collection  of  static armel binaries, the tree  structure  of  the
chroot  on the Galaxy note, as well as scripts and configuration files
used  for  monitoring,  backup,  etc from a remote  linux  server  via
cron.</p>

<a href="01_setup.html"><H2>C01 - Setting  up  the Samsung Galaxy Note as a Unix  Box</H2></a>

<p class=anno>(or at least as much as we can get away with it,  given
Google's kernel patches)</p>

<p>Last change: 20120216</p>

<pre>

This  article  is a demonstration of setting up an ordinary  <B>1GB
RAM  DUAL  CORE  PC</B> also known as <b>Samsung Galaxy  Note</b>  and
wrongly  accused to be merely a traditional style smartphone.

The only difference to the current crop of tablets is the display
density. Comparing hardware specifications of Note and PC (you want an
USB host port for external hardware: you already have one installed on
the  Note), the only interesting difference is in software, and in the
encoded  usage  / user interface assumptions. And I consider  some  of
Google's  assumptions  (derived from RAM-starved PDAs) to  be  already
obsolete in the face of current hardware.

So  for now, let's just prove Google wrong, and use the Galaxy Note
for  more than just remote USB storage and taking a few of your  files
along.

Let's escape from Google's dumb-down  getting-in-your-workflow
single-task  Android usage mode, while neither going full cloud  (with
all associated disadvantages) nor lugging around a laptop.

The  first  part  describes setting up enough of a real  Unix  user
space to actually permit proper use of the shell.

Building  on these basics, the second part looks at taking a  fully
customized  desktop  setup on the road: Create a  Desktop-size  DEBIAN
armel  CHROOT setup and make that a first class citizen in any LAN you
encounter  (ssh, file serving and filesystem mounting). The final step
is  running  a  local  X11 Desktop on the  Note,  using  the  chroot's
vncserver  or  Xvnc  (market: Xvnc). To access, either use  the  local
display of the Note or any PC with a vncviewer.

This  setup  is  enough  for  normal  LibreOffice  text
editing,   programming  or  some  light  web  browsing  (firefox9  and
chromium-browser  fail,  iceweasel/firefox  3.5 and  the  webkit/gecko
based  browsers  work), even without swap: I've usually  beyond  350MB
free  (free+buffers+cache) before starting X, which is enough for X11,
some xterms, firefox and LibreOffice.
