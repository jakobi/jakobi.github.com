<p>Besides some scripts, this directory contains a mothballed snapshot
of  my working Android environment intended to complement the articles
below (android-setup-example-files.tgz).</p>

<p>In  it  you  find the scripts for the Android  shell,  a
collection  of static armel binaries, the tree structure of the chroot
on  the  Galaxy note, as well as scripts and configuration files  used
for monitoring, backup, etc from a remote linux server via cron.</p>

<p>Current  versions of the more interesting scripts will be placed in
above   directory   (if   Android-specific)  or   elsewhere   in   the
script-archive (parts of my bash/ksh setup or generic Unix stuff).</p>

<a name=firstlook></a>
<H3>A first look at the Note / Web-Resources / Rooting</H3>

<p>This  article  sketches  a sane setup of GNU/Linux on  an  ordinary
<B>1-GB-RAM   DUAL-CORE  PC</B>  (henceforth  to  called   the   armel
architecture  Android device <b>Samsung Galaxy Note</b> GT-N7000).

<p>This is more than enough for a moderate desktop pc that is not used
for  heavy  gaming, virtualization or video editing. In this  article,
I'm     not     interested    in    audio/video    input/output     or
phone/s-pen/sensor/camera  use.</p>


<p><b>I/O options</b> include</p>
<ul>
<li>the OTG USB port, which permits to connect
<ul>
<li> the Note to the PC (adb, access to 
    the Note's FAT user filesystems) or
<li> some external USB hardware
    to the Note (Mouse/Keyboard/Memory stick, etc, as long an in-kernel
    driver is available)
<li>the HDMI connection cable (reuses the physical OTG port)
</ul>
<li>acting as either a WLAN-client or a WLAN Access Point
<li>networking over USB
<li>the S-pen - a real wacom-style stylus offering pressure-sensitivity
    and high resolution (not one of those useless iphone-style capacitive 
    finger-tip-replacements; better quality tablet-pc pens work
    on the Note offering both eraser and stylus)
<li>...
</ul>


<p><b>Flash  considerations</b>:  Choose a <i>quality</i> sdhc microsd
flash, 16  or 32GB.
Read speeds for the internal flash are 50+ MB/s and 18MB/s
for  Sandisk.</p>

<p  class=anno>After bad experiences with both Class 10 Transcend  and
Lexar,  I've  now settled on a reliable Sandisk class 4  16GB  microsd
flash.  As Sandisk chooses labels according to the minimum write rate,
it  is nearly as fast as the others. One advantage is that I no longer
find the chroot remounted read-only, as this means to shutdown/restart
the chroot and running fsck (no loss of data though). When switching I
had  a  look at the external sdcard's FAT filesystem and  my  titanium
backup:  Massive  data corruption. Flash problems may well  have  been
worsened  by  whatever timeout changes, etc, Google patched  into  the
kernel.</p>



<p><b>Power  considerations</b>:  Enable automatic battery savings  in
Settings. Turn off WLAN and GPS - the location by cell towers is still
pretty exact. If necessary, you can also use titanium backup to freeze
some of the more annoying apps in your firmware (kies, socialhub).</p>

<p><b>Things to avoid</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>adb and using symlinks in Android-side paths - silent failure.
<li>bad flash (in all possible senses of the word :)
<li>kies (connectivity suite / flashing windows software provided by Samsung)
<li>use of app2sd: do move all apps to the phone (/data) - the core of
    the Android framework has <B>MAJOR PROBLEMS</B> with apps on sdcards,
    upto and including hanging in a boot-loop (recover by full wipe or
    by adb shell from the PC and removing any packages on the sdcards;
    access by ssh with sshdroid is not possible).
</ul>



<h4>The Whys of Rooting</H4>

Besides  getting faster access to upstream security and bug fixes than
by  waiting for something to trickle down rom Google to Hardware Maker
to Provider to OTA distribution, rooting enables more options for

<ul>
<li>backup/restore
<li>battery management
<li>privacy (LBA, aspotcat, ...; iptables-based "personal" outbound firewalls)
<li>routing (improved tethering and intelligent "routing" at ip route/iptables level)
<li>security (lookout, avast; the ability to create a real iptables-based inbound packet-filter/firewall)
<li>access to non-Android programs, for the Android shell or for a chroot
    maybe containing a full DEBIAN or Ubuntu.
</ul>

Depending  on how you root the device, the flash counter may  increase
(though that <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1354888">301K
resistor  field testing jig</a> may help). But in case of mailing  in
the  device, you need to reflash a stock firmware anyway. In  summary:
so what.




<h4>Research Phase</h4>

<p><b>Web Resources</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.androidnz.net/2011/12/samsung-galaxy-note-complete-review.html">AndroidNZ review with some app suggestions</a>
<li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1349">XDA Note forum</a>
<li><a href="http://sammobile.com" <a>Sammobile</a>: (aka samfirmware.com == samsung-firmwares.com; also contains stock images for reflashing)
</ul>

<p>ROMs  are very device specific, so Android ecosystem and  community
are  <i>extremely fragmented</i>: <b>Good community support and custom
roms  are  a  pre-requirement for buying</b>. Some custom  roms  reuse
stock  kernels,  some use custom kernel builds (usually based  on
Android Open Source Project (AOSP); e.g. cyanogenmod).</p>

<p   class=anno>Bad  makers  or  lack  of  community  lead  to   early
obsolescence  of the device and wasted money (consider the  disastrous
Motorola  Milestone).  Depending on the number of non-standard  chips,
various firmware-blobs might be required to get a fully working kernel
/  firmware. With some makers not even supporting devices, the initial
release  kernel might well be the only Linux kernel ever working on  a
device  (again the Milestone example). This will also worsen community
support  and  shorten  availability  of community  firmware  for  this
maker's devices (which has to reuse the old buggy kernel). <b>Some</b>
of  this  is visible for the Note as well: the unofficial  CM9  builds
still lack blobs for camera and accelerated display.</p>

<h4>Pre-Flashing Checklist</h4>


<p><i>Do  update and validate titanium backups (doubly so on  external
sdcards) before flashing new firmware. Copy the backups to
your PC (e.g. as port of a nightly backup schedule).</i>.</p>

<pre>
keep a backup of /efs (imei!)

odin: http://droidangel.blogspot.com/2011/05/odin-multi-downloader-flasher-program.html
      we need odin3 v183 or 185

for simpler cases, mobile odin / cfroot cwm should suffice

see the support threads of the chosen kernel


</pre>



<h4>The Way of Rooting (Tourist Travel Sketch, with dogeared threads)</h4>

<p>At the end of the research phase, you should have selected a target
custom  rom, and maybe one or more intermediate steps if you start out
with  a  stock rom. In my case the sequence led from stock to  a  full
install  of the older KJ1 with CFROOT/CWM, and then forward to Chris_X
4lph4 roms offering KL8 using the AbyssNote 2.6.35 Kernel.</p>

<p><b>Stock to Chainfire KJ1 including the modified factoryfs</b> (see
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1331784">posting
1+2</a>).  If  your  rom doesn't offer CFROOT/CWM, you first  need  to
install  a version of ODIN on Windows that lists the Note as supported
(v3  version 1.83 or 1.85 was the one I found - there doesn't seem  to
be  any official home page or author, nor any sane version numbering).
For  Linux,  Heimdall  might  work (untested). To set  the  Note  into
download  mode,  use lower-vol + home + power and connect to USB.  For
more detail, check the XDA threads for your selected ROM.</p>

<p><b>Chainfire     KJ1     to    Chris_X    4lph4</b>     (see     <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1424401">XDA</a>).
As  we  now  have CFROOT/CWM available, this step no  longer  requires
Windows  and Odin. I repeated this step once to go to a newer ROM from
Chris,  currently  the v1.0.5 from early January which is very  stable
(excluding  Google's  carefully  prepared pitfalls  concerning  shared
memory  and  system_server  vs app2sd). 

<p  class=anno>As of mid February, Chris is at v1.7. I will follow him
irregularly  until ICS is available as a CFROOT/CWM supported rom.  In
the long run, I'll expect to end up with CM9 or newer.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure a high battery level first.
<li>Entering recovery: CWM application or upper vol + home + power
<li>Using CWM to delete the contents of the cache partition and dalvik
cache  is  a  good  idea (the last adds about  15min  to  the  initial
boot).
<li>You may need to be selective in restoring titanium backups: browser 
and market may have different versions, so restoring user data may lead to force crashes.
This fragility is why Chris strongly requires full wipes as part of the install. Note
that restoring 300 user apps takes a whee bit of time.
<li>If you made a CWM Backup before flashing, do not use it as-is from CWM
recovery, as you'd restore the previous state and fully or partially undo
a successful flashing. Though it's perfect to undo a bad flashing or to go back
from testing another ROM.
</ul>



<h4>Post Flashing Checklist</H4>

<pre>
only apk:
- cleaning data/dalvik-cache and /cache adds about 12min to initial bootup instead of 30+
  -> dalvik kind of precompiles or rather indexes positions inside the apk bundle
  (apk: jars and c++ system libs to be used from within the file by the dalvik engine,
   the c++ stuff either on the fly or pre-extracted and installed into /system or /data(?);
   however, for apk installed on sdcard/apps2sd we strangely use a loopmount claiming 
   apk to be fat per application, thus possibly avoiding the libs in /system or /data,
   but then again, this still does leave some MB per app in the system/data flash partitions :( )
- system and twlaunch kind of app-launch dalvik children to run apps, but some of
  the two system/twlaunch keep a lot of pipes, to fwd e.g. input or android events I think?
- NEVER OVERWRITE BUSYBOXES IN */bin (kills cfroot); at most IF REQUIRED put them into some xbin 
- /data/local/zImage ist auf dem Handy. zImage Verzeichnis InitialCFRootFlasher on PC. 
- frosting / defrost system: adb shell: pm list packages, pm enable <package>, titanium backup
  /data/system/packages.xml  -> set enabled="true" here
</pre>



<h4>Software</h4>

<p>1. Nice to have market apps to improve on Android graphical offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>aspotcat, lookout, lbe privacy guard (security, permissions, receivers, intents)
<li>clipper, clip ninja, floatmemo (without a window system, we need help to transfer data between apps)
<li>clocksync (to keep your clock in sync with NTP)
<li>coolapps (system load widget and much more)
<li>jota (nice text editor)
<li>mobile odin
<li>printbot, scanthing (printing and scanning, with OCR via update to google docs)
<li>ringguard (don't accidentally change ring tone loudness)
<li>smart taskswitcher, task manager
<li>tasker (programmable android event handling, can substitute for cron, can turn on/off WLAN depending on location, etc)
<li>terminal emulator
<li>zdbox (task killing, moving apps from sdcard to phone)
</ul>

<p  class=anno>(voice recognition and more than word-level handwriting
recognition aren't quite there yet in gingerbread)</p>


<p>2. Required market apps for the rest of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>busybox installer (stericson, use /system/xbin as installation path)
<li>connectbot (use ssh to connect to remote systems)
<li>fileexpert or any other filemanager capable of accessing non-sdcard directories
<li>sshdroid (permit incoming ssh connections, dropbear-based)
<li>superuser (usually part of the custom firmware we install)
<li>terminal ide (a pretty complete unix user space for the Android shell)
<li>titanium backup (backup and restore apps, also offers dealing with offending (firmware) apps)
<li>xvnc or vnc viewer
<li>mostly optional: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">sl4a and perl</a> (perl/python/lua wrapper
    examples are availble for use of the languages in the Android shell; some of my scripts may require perl)
</ul>

<p class=anno>(there  also  are one or two apps that may simplify setting  up  the
chroot   for  sections  3  and  4  of  this  article  (market:   Linux
installer))</p>


<p>3. PC-side applications</p>
<ul>
<li>adb (in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk">Android SDK</a>, tools directory)
</ul>

<H3>Adding Unix Standards to the Android Shell</H3>


<-- -------------------------^^^ clean \/\/\/ borked ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<pre>
The  second  part describes setting up enough of a real  Unix  user
space to actually permit proper use of the shell.

using root / adb:
- vim
- bash (found static)                    *
- mc (found static)                      * <- in an apkg installer
- strace (found static binary)           *
after running iterminal-ide, also:            
- tmux


if necessary insmod logger.ko

TERMIDE
BUSYBOX
SSHDROID

VPN

# openssh5.8p2 (what was my issue here???)
/data/data/org.sshtunnel.beta/sshtunnel

# dropbear
/data/data/com.spartacusrex.spartacuside/files/system/bin/ssh
/data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/dropbear/ssh

already working:

tethering: just modprobe usbnet and use usb0.
alternately use the ap mode and wlan
proxies: sshtunnel, ORBOT.


try not to mix busybox versions or GNU.

running a script with busybox sh and using e.g. a GNU grep within a pipe
also containing busybox commands may create write failures (busybox has
to take shortcuts in setting up pipes to cope with crippled kernels)

do  NOT use toolbox aka /system/bin/sh for real shell scripts, as  PWD
handling,   $0  and  other  stuff  is  rather  questionable   (writing
CHROOT.run I did run into at least 2 such bugs).

creating a mess: fail to maintain standard configuration and create a new one:
- bionic (lacking) / getprop/ setprop: the Google way.
- various libc implementations: the Unix way, e.g. /etc/resolv.conf

results in interesting breakage: TERMIDE's busybox e.g. lacks DNS-resolving,
Depending on lacking libraries libnss_dns.so does disable the rest.

Only running Busybox-Installer (market) to install busybox into /system/xbin
permits you to do DNS lookups. 

in the end I'm using a iresolver alias to reorder path when I need DNS when using TERMIDE.

<H3>CHROOT and Turning the Android into a First Class LAN Citizen</H3>

<pre>


shortcoming: no kernel updates / no security fixes / as 3D/GPU stuff and
e.g. camera often involve binary firmware blobs, choice of kernel is further limited, if you want
to retain access to the by-design-crippled devices.

security  and maintainability is certainly not comparable to a  native
debian install, where the kernel is properly select by grub on boot, as we're restricted
to mere userspace.

---

note: debian or ubuntu armhf port (efficient support of FPU)
I had a look at the new armhf debian architecture to be, but the repo I used was
too incomplete to even survive debootstrap stage 1.

Building  on these basics, the third part looks at taking a  fully
customized  desktop  setup on the road: Create a  Desktop-size  DEBIAN
armel  CHROOT setup and make that a first class citizen in any LAN you
encounter  (ssh, file serving and filesystem mounting).
</pre>

<a name=vnc></a>
<H3>Desktop and X11</H3>


<pre>


The  final  step is running a local X11 Desktop on the Note,  using
the  chroot's vncserver or Xvnc (market: Xvnc). To access, either  use
the local display of the Note or any PC with a vncviewer.

This  setup  is  enough  for  normal  LibreOffice  text
editing,   programming  or  some  light  web  browsing  (firefox9  and
chromium-browser  fail,  iceweasel/firefox  3.5 and  the  webkit/gecko
based  browsers  work), even without swap: I've usually  beyond  350MB
free  (free+buffers+cache) before starting X, which is enough for X11,
some xterms, firefox and LibreOffice.

Q: consider some encrypted loop mount ???

My  suspicions  on being very careful wrt using swap: SSD should  have
flash  translation layers (if cheaper flash actually has that at all):
A FAT fielsystem is simle (only the first few blocks are rewritten all
the  time). Database transaction logs are even simpler (all blocks get
rewritten  in sequence, so "wear and tear" is balanced) - both  permit
trivial  flash translation layers, or actually coping without any. Now
swap  and filesystem journals are differing: rist select a semi-random
set of blocks, and then rewrite them all the time.

Suggestion:  enable  swap  with  a very  stringent  swappiness  value;
despite  speed and quality differences, place swap (if at all) on  the
external sdcard, and only activate it when required.



the frequent firmware updates of quality vendors for all early ssd shows the severity of the issues wrt Flash.
