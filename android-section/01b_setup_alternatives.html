<H3>NLSU2 OPTWARE</H3>


<p>OPTWARE  strives  to  provide package  management  with  dependency
tracking  for  embedded Linux devices. The best known OPTWARE  targets
are  probably the nslu2, anything wrt54*/openwrt, the Sharp Zaurus and
maybe nowadays the sheevaplug. On these devices, OPTWARE tries hard to
stay  just  within  /opt  and outside of the native  setup,  with  the
possible  exception of requiring some links in /bin and /lib at  least
during bootstrapping (which doesn't matter for Android).</p>

<p>OPTWARE's  easily  enough  to  get a  moderately  sane  environment
(embedded,  and  this  _includes_ Android) up and running,  but  don't
expect  debian levels of up-to-dateness and completeness (though  some
packages  have  this  week's timestamp). It certainly  beats  isolated
Android  native  port  attempts  with their  always  occurring  bionic
problems.  Also note that while OPTWARE offers a few feeds with (rare)
kernel  updates  for  specific devices, Android  is  <b>not</b>  among
those.</p>

<H4>Bootstrapping OPTWARE</H4>

<p>Prerequisites  for  the demonstration: <b>Root Access</b></p>

<p  class=anno>  (due to mount-bind and symlinks in /bin, /lib,  /etc;
without  being  able to use root, all you can use to  improve  Android
shell-side  is  installing  sshdroid and TERMINAL  IDE  apps;  however
Android  2.3 is sufficiently buggy to really require rooting to  cope,
regardless of all the additional abilities enabled by rooting)</p>

<p>Set  up  a  slightly  more comfortable  environment  by  using  the
TERMINAL  IDE binaries and placing DNS-resolving copy of busybox first
in  PATH (stericson; but in the end, I still suffered busybox  issues,
so this is still insufficient). This step is mostly cosmetic, and even
without  a  working  native wget, you can just use a  web  browser  or
another host instead for the wget invocations.</p>

<pre>
# optional...
TERMIDE
iresolver
</pre>

<p>I  have  some spare space on the ext4 filesystem mounted on /x  (as
described  in the chroot setup in article 1). If you have at least 100
MB  on  /data  beyond the 10% free threshold, you can also  use  /data
(with  some  Unix  and GNU standards including gcc, I am  using  about
300M). The cs08q1armel feed is compatible with Android (in my case the
Samsung   Galaxy   Note),   and  offers  two  branches:   stable   and
unstable.</p>

<pre>
export FEED=http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/cs08q1armel/cross/stable
export OPTROOT=/x/optware # WHEREVER YOU WANT, BUT NOT ON FAT!
</pre>

<p>First  attempt is to roughly follow the basic instructions given at
the  bottom of the OPTWARE homepage. But this fails, as ipkg cannot be
loaded  due  to missing libraries (any embedded libc would  have  been
probably  OK, but not Google's bionic). That is, if the available  tar
implements -O ...</p>

<pre>
mkdir $OPTROOT
cd $OPTROOT

ipk_name=`wget -qO- $FEED/Packages | awk '/^Filename: ipkg-opt/ {print $2}'`
wget $FEED/$ipk_name
tar -xOvzf $ipk_name ./data.tar.gz | tar -C $OPTROOT -xzvf -
mkdir -p $OPTROOT/opt/etc/ipkg
echo "src cross $FEED" &gt; $OPTDIR/opt/etc/ipkg/feeds.conf

# optional/symlink IFF you've already a sane /etc/resolv.conf
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 &gt; opt/etc/resolv.conf

export PATH=/opt/bin:/bin:$OPTROOT/bin:$OPTROOT/opt/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/opt/lib:$OPTROOT/lib:$OPTROOT/opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH # unnecessary?

# FAIL despite LD_LIBRARY and all
# ipkg update
# for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}; do ipkg install $i; done
</pre>

<p>Searching  the net offers an optware-for-android script by pfalcon,
pointing  to  a  tarball containing our missing  files  among  others.
Longer  download,  but  less  trouble  in  hunting  down  the  missing
libraries.  So let's follow that one. Note that we need working  https
access  (only)  for  the tarball containing our  libs,  which  neither
stericson  busybox nor my static wget support - so this is the  single
step not possible to do locally.</p>

<pre>
# fetch_package_index, in case we want to lookup something, probably optional
wget -q $FEED/Packages
mkdir opt 
# mkdir home root home/user

# my Android-side wget hates https (step requires about 20 minutes!)
CHROOT.run wget https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package2549/public/+++
   +++arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
# extract ldd and the missing libs
tar jxf arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
( cd arm-2008q1/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/lib &amp;&amp; find | cpio -pmd $OPTROOT/lib )
( cd arm-2008q1/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/usr/bin &amp;&amp; find ldd | cpio -pmd $OPTROOT/bin )
# rm -r arm-2008q1 arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

# as we cannot quite rely on busybox sanity (and certainly not on Google's toolbox)
# we unpack the ipkg as above, plus busybox and wget
get_package_fname () { awk "/^Filename: ${1}_/ {print \$2}" Packages; }
for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}; do wget -q $FEED/$(get_package_fname $i); done
for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}*ipk; do tar -zxf $i ./data.tar.gz; tar -zxf data.tar.gz; done
rm data.tar.gz
# rm *ipk

# esp. update-alternatives doesn't like dealing with a bad busybox setup. And it
# needs sh (or /bin/sh) to be compatible to rm (/bin/rm ...) it uses. IFF it honors
# PATH, placing /system/xbin first in PATH and removing /bin/sh _might_ suffice.
( cd bin &amp;&amp; for i in sh echo rm sed mkdir head sort dirname ln mv; do ln -s /opt/bin/busybox $i; done )

# Note that we still need to run the initial ipkg invocations to properly
# initialize package management.
</pre>

<p>Everything  upto now can also be done outside the Android, with the
tree  at $OPTROOT just being copied over afterwards (do not forget  to
export OPTROOT=&lt;your android dir&gt;). From now on, we need to work
locally  on  the  Android  device,  first  in  creating  the   optware
environment, and afterwards to run ipkg natively (if you don't want to
do  this  yet, you could experiment with the -d/-o options  and  non-/
installs - untested).</p>

<p>The  original setup recipe would have been mostly sufficient for  a
working  setup  in  case  of OPTROOT=/,  with  suitable  writable  ext
diskspace  on  /opt. As I chose a different OPTROOT to  keep  all
OPTWARE  files  together,  I have to  still symlink  or  mount-bind,  in
addition  to  providing  a  sane mtab and  resolv.conf (which  bionic
doesn't use).</p>

<pre>
# you'll see most of this again in the OPTWARE script below
# this is one-time and will survive reboots
mount -oremount,rw /system
( cd /etc &amp;&amp; ln -s /proc/mounts mtab ) 
( cd /etc &amp;&amp; touch resolv.conf )
mount -oremount,ro /system

# this must be done after each boot
mount -oremount,rw /
rm /bin/sh                              # we _need_ a symlink to busybox here
( cd /bin &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/* . )   # only ldd for now  - android: usually unused
( cd /lib &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/lib/* . )   # libc and the like - android: unused except /lib/modules
mkdir /opt /home /tmp
mount -oremount,ro /

# optional mounts
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # already in /etc/resolv.conf
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/home /home

# optware mount bind (you may use a symlink instead if /opt is empty)
mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt  /opt
</pre>

<p>The final step is initializing the ipkg package management.</p>

<pre>
ipkg update
for i in ipkg-opt wget busybox; do ipkg install $i; done
</pre>

<p>This  completes a minimal OPTWARE setup.</p>

<p>OPTWARE  offers  1300+ packages, most of which should be useful  on
Android  (maybe  excluding  alsa/sound-related apps,  syslog  and  nfs
packages).  The  feed includes among others a minimal client-side  X11
setup,   servers   from   tftp  to  inetutils,   apache   and   samba,
cups/enscript/groff/ghostscript/mpage/psutils,
openvpn/strongswan/stunnel/vtun,  bash,  perl, php, python, ruby,  and
even 9base/rc.</p>

<p>For  a  fairly  small  setup,  consider  installing  the  following
packages:  <i>mc vim tmux elinks w3m less perl python bash gzip  bzip2
unzip  p7zip  cpio  diffutils findutils grep mktemp  net-tools  netcat
openssh  openssl  openvpn  rsync  wget lsof  ltrace  strace  e2fsprogs
e2tools gnupg man man-pages xauth xterm autoconf gcc automake binutils
flex  make  optware-devel</i>. Missing dependencies will  be  resolved
automatically by ipkg (about 100 packages, 300M).</p>


<br>
<H4>Customizing the Environment for OPTWARE</H4>

<p>To  make OPTWARE available after rebooting, you need to restore the
above changes to the transient rootfs (symlinks, mountpoints, possibly
also mounts).</p>

<pre>
# file /system/xbin/OPTWARE

export OPTROOT=/x/optware # *** UNRELATED TO CHROOT despite PATH*** 

## /system: this is one-time and will survive reboots
#mount -oremount,rw /system
#( cd /etc &amp;&amp; ln -s /proc/mounts mtab ) 
#( cd /etc &amp;&amp; touch resolv.conf )
#mount -oremount,ro /system

# /: transient rootfs mod - required after each boot
# note that we might be able to remove some of the symlinks, as we
# now have a full OPTWARE setup (untested)
mount -oremount,rw /
rm /bin/sh                              # we _need_ a symlink to busybox here
( cd /bin &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/* . 2&gt;/dev/null )   # only ldd for now  - android: usually unused
( cd /lib &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/lib/* . 2&gt;/dev/null )   # libc and the like - android: unused except /lib/modules
mkdir /opt /home /tmp 2&gt;/dev/null
mount -oremount,ro /

# optional mounts
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # already in /etc/resolv.conf
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/home /home

# optware mount bind (you may use a symlink instead if /opt is empty)
mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt  /opt

echo source /opt/optware.env for use of the optware environment
</pre>



<p>To use OPTWARE, you need to at least add OPTWARE to the PATH. In my
case, I use these files:<p>

<pre>
# file /opt/optware.env

# we may need to also consider LD_LIBRARY_PATH ?

export OPTWARE_POS="first"
[ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "first" ] &amp;&amp; PATH="/opt/bin:$PATH"
[ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "last"  ] &amp;&amp; PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"
</pre>

<pre>
# .bash_aliases.pj

function ioptware { test -d /opt || sudo OPTWARE; test -f /opt/optware.env &amp;&amp; . /opt/optware.env; }

if [ "$HOSTNAME_CHROOT" = "" ]; then
   # probably invoked via TERMIDE script or TERMIDE app
   ...
   [ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "first" ] &amp;&amp; PATH="/opt/bin:$PATH"
   [ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "last"  ] &amp;&amp; PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"
   ...
fi
</pre>

<p>For  further shell customization, see <a href="01_setup.html">first
article  and  the  TERMINAL IDE/CHROOT setup</a>,  esp.  the  examples
.bash_aliases.pj and .bashrc.pj</p>

<H4>OPTWARE Issues</H4>

<ul>
<li><i>screen</i> fails to work (but as this also happens in debian chroot - kernel!?)
<li>there is no <i>ipkg</i> man page (neither locally, in man-pages.ipk, nor online) - 
    <i>ipkg --help</i>, the <a href="http://svn.nslu2-linux.org/svnroot/optware/trunk/sources/ipkg-opt/">sources</a> 
    and the <a href="http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_ipkg_package_management_system">buffalo-nas-central page</a> 
    are about the best resources to be found. Handhelds.org and the official sources there
    are currently offline (<a href="http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=85R6BA74HERURGXTRM7RD4H4AH">copy at koders</a>).

<br>
<h4>Size and Capability Comparison</h4>

<p>sshdroid  is  about 2M, the files in /system/xbin 10M: Basic  shell
access  by adb and ssh, file and logcat access. TERMINAL IDE  requires
ca.  120M:  This  permits light shell use and light development  in  a
graphical  terminal  app. With some effort, this is also  usable  from
outside  the application. Adding my "fairly small" OPTWARE setup takes
another  300M  (108 packages), adding some improvements (especially  a
better  shell environment with proper libc and GNU utilities, gcc  and
non-SL4A  scripting  options), some server software and a  very  basic
xterm / X11 client.</p>

<p>In  constrast  the debian chroot from article 1 is installed  on  a
separate  ext4 partition on the external sdcard, with currently  about
3.5G  (1200  packages) used by debian proper. However it  additionally
permits  use  as  a  mobile (remote)  _full_  graphical  desktop-level
environment    including   Libre-Office,   LaTeX   and    unrestricted
development.</p>

<p  class=anno>Android  2.3.6 on my Note weighs in at about 2.3GB  for
190 system and 300 user apps, with another few hundred MB found on the
internal  sdcard, not counting personal media files and backup  files.
While offering some mobile and graphical usability, it does <b>not</b>
offer  proper  shell  use nor desktop-level  capabilities  (mobile  or
otherwise).</p>

<a name=milestones></a>
<h3>Milestones in Increasing and Extending Update Availability Despite Vendor Whims</h3>

<h4>Unix Shell and Remote GUI Updates and</H4>

<p>In the long run, to be used with new software, security patches and
bug fixes, any device needs to permit at minimum a chroot with package
management  and hopefully vnc. At the latest, this must be  available,
when  the  vendor has obsoleted the device. Otherwise, the user  is  a
remote-controlled usee and repeatedly replaces devices at the vendor's
whim.</p>

<p  class=anno>Some Android vendors don't offer any support/updates at
all,  so the buy-replacement-device-interval of their dreams might  as
well be called a monetary ZERO-DAY exploit.</p>

<p>OPTWARE,  or better yet, a debian chroot (as installed on my  Note)
guarantees  a vendor-independent level of real longterm support  until
either  the device develops actual hardware issues or the user changes
his device use patterns sufficiently to consider a new device (say, to
read A4 documents full-screen without zooming).</p>

<h4>Newer Android Framework Updates by Custom-Rom to</h4>

<p>To  permit  secure use outside the home (and within -&gt; defense in depth!), a  device  also
needs  uptodate  methods  to access the new applications, that  is  an
uptodate  GUI  with  at least uptodate versions of VNC-Viewer  (for
access  to  current apps in the chroot), browser and ssh.</p>

<p>As  Android Market doesn't permit marketplace links/updating for
rom apps (about 200 alone on a modern Android 2.3.6 device), this is a
problem-in-wait  that can only be delayed by moving to custom roms, at the latest when the
device  ages  out  of  vendor  support.</p>

<p>However, custom  roms still suffer  the
compatibility  limits  of  vendor-provided blobs  (or  possibly  stock
kernels, cf. Motorola Milestone). Add Android fragmentation and custom
rom support will wane later on, as will marketplace app availability.
Even  the chroot environment will suffer some of that bitrot, as newer
and  missing  kernel features will preclude building or using  some
programs.</p>

<p>Note  that  custom  rom  availability  further  depends  on  vendor
behaviour and device popularity.</p>

<h4>Longterm Native Linux (possibly also Dual-Booting)</h4>

<p>At  this  point in time, we can either happily accept any bugs  and
security  flaws.  Alternately  we can vow to only use  the  device  in
totally  secure  protected  environments  in as  secure  a  manner  as
possible.  Like  inside a bank tresor with the battery removed. Or  we
can  accept  some  loss  of funtionality due  to  firmware  blobs  for
uncommon  and crippled hardware components (most likely candidates are
sensors,  maybe  camera,  and  3d  acceleration,  possibly  also  some
wifi/gsm  functionality) and consider switching (or dual-booting) to a
native   graphical   interface  and/or  a  native  kernel   (AOSP   or
official).</p>

<p>Now  our own official end of support only happens for either  dying
hardware/flash memory, change of user requirements, or device hardware
being  actively  dropped  from Xorg (/wayland(?))  and  kernel  source
code.</p>

<p>For  proper long term support, the results of working X11 /  kernel
modifications  for  a device also need to be pushed upstream into  the
official   sources,   and  ideally  also  be  packaged   by   embedded
distributions   (which  lag  in  tracking  upstream),  better  yet  by
mainstream  distributions  like  debian:  a  native  setup  of  debian
unstable  installable with only a little manual intervention is the final
perfect long-term device support scenario.</p>

<p  class=anno>Otherwise, we're stuck at a series of  badly-repeatable
one shot demonstrations, that require some to huge effort ranging from
