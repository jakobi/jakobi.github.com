<H3>NLSU2 OPTWARE</H3>


<p>OPTWARE  strives  to  provide package  management  with  dependency
tracking  for usually headless embedded Linux devices. The best  known
OPTWARE  targets are probably the nslu2, anything wrt54*/openwrt,  the
Sharp  Zaurus  and  maybe nowadays the sheevaplug. On  these  devices,
OPTWARE  tries hard to stay just within /opt and outside of the native
setup, with the possible exception of requiring some links in /bin and
/lib   at  least  during  bootstrapping  (which  doesn't  matter   for
Android).</p>

<p>OPTWARE  is  easily  enough to get a  moderately  sane  environment
(embedded,  and  this  _includes_ Android) up and running,  but  don't
expect  debian levels of up-to-dateness and completeness (though  some
packages  do have this week's timestamp). It certainly beats  isolated
<i>too-native</i>  Android native port attempts with their  associated
bionic  problems. Also note that while OPTWARE offers a few feeds with
(rare) kernel updates a full environment for specific devices, Android
is <b>not</b> among those.</p>

<H4>Bootstrapping OPTWARE on Android</H4>

<p>Prerequisites  for  the demonstration: <b>Root Access</b></p>

<p  class=anno>  (due to mount-bind and symlinks in /bin, /lib,  /etc;
without  being  able to use root, all you can use to  improve  Android
shell-side  is  installing  sshdroid and TERMINAL  IDE  apps;  however
Android  2.3 is sufficiently buggy to really require rooting to  cope,
regardless  of all the additional abilities enabled by rooting)</p>

<p>(if  you still need some hints or convincing to root your  Android,
leave  this  page and read part 1 of my <a href="01_setup.html">first
Android  article</a> instead. When rooted, you can continue there with
TERMINAL IDE and the suggestions of part 2. If that's insufficient, or
you  want  to avoid my kind of outside-of-app abuse of  TERMINAL  IDE,
either  do  continue here with OPTWARE or otherwise consider a  chroot
setup  of  one of the distributions below. For this you can  refer  to
parts 3 and 4 of the first article to set up a debian chroot upto full
desktop-level remote GUI - pretty standard excluding maybe CHROOT.run;
a  hack  you  only need to consider in case  of  transparently  mixing
chroot-side  commands in an outside-of-chroot pipe. Not quite standard
however  is  the  described level of LAN integration,  and  definitely
non-standard  and unexpected-to-me were the work-arounds I was  forced
to  develop  for  Android kernel issues encountered in  the  described
tests everywhere from parts 2 to 4)</p>

<p>Set  up  a  slightly  more comfortable  environment  by  using  the
TERMINAL  IDE binaries and place a DNS-resolving copy of busybox first
in  PATH (stericson; but in the end, I still suffered busybox  issues,
so  this  caution didn't pay beyond a nicer shell prompt  and  command
line  editing).  This  step  is mostly cosmetic, and  even  without  a
working native wget, you can just use a browser or another host's wget
to download the the tarball and the three initial ipkg packages.</p>

<pre>
TERMIDE
iresolver
</pre>

<p>I  have  some spare space on the ext4 filesystem mounted on /x  (as
described  in the chroot setup in article 1). If you have at least 100
MB  on  /data  beyond the 10% free threshold, you can also  use  /data
(with some Unix and GNU standards including gcc, I need about 300M for
OPTWARE).  The cs08q1armel feed is compatible with Android (in my case
the  Samsung  Galaxy  Note),  and  offers  two  branches:  stable  and
unstable.</p>

<pre>
export FEED=http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/cs08q1armel/cross/stable
export OPTROOT=/x/optware # WHEREVER YOU WANT, BUT NOT ON FAT!
</pre>

<p>First  attempt is to roughly follow the basic instructions given at
the  bottom of the OPTWARE homepage. But this fails, as ipkg cannot be
loaded due to missing libraries (any embedded libc would have been OK,
but  Google just had to go bionic). That is, if tar implements -O  ...
(otherwise   just  use  a  few  additional  temp  files   instead   of
piping).</p>

<pre>
mkdir $OPTROOT
cd $OPTROOT

ipk_name=`wget -qO- $FEED/Packages | awk '/^Filename: ipkg-opt/ {print $2}'`
wget $FEED/$ipk_name
tar -xOvzf $ipk_name ./data.tar.gz | tar -C $OPTROOT -xzvf -
mkdir -p $OPTROOT/opt/etc/ipkg
echo "src cross $FEED" &gt; $OPTDIR/opt/etc/ipkg/feeds.conf

# optional/symlink IFF you've already a sane /etc/resolv.conf
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 &gt; opt/etc/resolv.conf

export PATH=/opt/bin:/bin:$OPTROOT/bin:$OPTROOT/opt/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/opt/lib:$OPTROOT/lib:$OPTROOT/opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH # unnecessary?

# FAIL despite LD_LIBRARY and all
# ipkg update
# for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}; do ipkg install $i; done
</pre>

<p>Searching  the net offers an optware-for-android script by pfalcon,
pointing  to  a  tarball containing our missing  files  among  others.
Longer  download,  but  less trouble than trying to  locate  the  ipkg
packages   containing   our   missing  libraries,   plus   all   their
dependencies.  So let's use that script as a rough guide.</p>

<p>Note  that we need working https access for the tarball  containing
our  libs,  which  neither  my stericson busybox nor  my  static  wget
support  -  so this is the single step I could not do in  the  Android
shell.</p>

<pre>
# fetch_package_index, in case we want to lookup something, probably optional
wget -q $FEED/Packages
mkdir opt 
# mkdir home root home/user

# my Android-side wget hates https, so I use my debian chroot's wget 
# (step requires about 20 minutes; just download the tarball somehow - bonus
#  points if you do it on the Android using google's browser app - and copy 
#  it into $OPTROOT; do mind the +++ linebreak when pasting)
CHROOT.run wget https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package2549/public/+++
   +++arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

# extract ldd and the missing libs from the tarball
tar jxf arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
( cd arm-2008q1/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/lib &amp;&amp; find | cpio -pmd $OPTROOT/lib )
( cd arm-2008q1/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/usr/bin &amp;&amp; find ldd | cpio -pmd $OPTROOT/bin )
# rm -r arm-2008q1 arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

# as we cannot quite rely on busybox sanity being sufficient for ipkg and
# update-alternatives use (and certainly there's only sanity to be lost in
# considering Google's toolbox clone of busybox), we unpack the minimal
# working set of packages for a working ipkg package management manually: 
# ipkg-opt, busybox-base, wget...
#
# note the requirement to remove any previous non-busybox /bin/sh (below) -
# even a really sane busybox is capricious when mixing commands in pipes
# in shell scripts run with busybox sh.
get_package_fname () { awk "/^Filename: ${1}_/ {print \$2}" Packages; }
for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}; do wget -q $FEED/$(get_package_fname $i); done
for i in {wget,ipkg-opt,busybox-base}*ipk; do tar -zxf $i ./data.tar.gz; tar -zxf data.tar.gz; done
rm data.tar.gz
# rm *ipk
( cd bin &amp;&amp; for i in sh echo rm sed mkdir head sort dirname ln mv; do ln -s /opt/bin/busybox $i; done )

# Note that we still need to run the initial ipkg invocations to properly
# initialize package management.
</pre>

<p>Everything  upto now can also be done outside the Android, with the
tree  at $OPTROOT just being copied over afterwards (do not forget  to
export  OPTROOT=&lt;your android dir&gt; on the Android). From now on,
however,  we  need  to work locally on the Android  device,  first  in
creating  the optware environment, and afterwards to run ipkg natively
(if you don't want to do this yet, you could experiment with the -d/-o
options and non-/ installs - not tested).</p>

<p>The  original setup recipe would have been mostly sufficient for  a
working  setup  in  case of OPTROOT=/, with  suitable  writable  ext2+
diskspace  at /opt. As I chose a different OPTROOT to keep all OPTWARE
files  together  (too  paranoid  this  time,  as  OPTWARE  is  <b>very
clean</b>  to  setup,  minimizing intrusions into the  outside  system
files), I have to still symlink or mount-bind, in addition to providing
a sane mtab and resolv.conf (which bionic doesn't use).</p>

<pre>
# you'll see most of this again in the OPTWARE script below
# this is one-time and will survive reboots
mount -oremount,rw /system
( cd /etc &amp;&amp; ln -s /proc/mounts mtab ) 
( cd /etc &amp;&amp; touch resolv.conf )
mount -oremount,ro /system

# this must be done after each boot
mount -oremount,rw /

#### initially, we _*NEED*_ a symlink to busybox sh here
test -x $OPTROOT/bin/sh && ( rm /bin/sh 2>/dev/null; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/sh . )
#### claiming bonus points for excess paranoia :)

( cd /bin &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/* . )   # only ldd for now  - android: usually unused
( cd /lib &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/lib/* . )   # libc and the like - android: unused except /lib/modules
mkdir /opt /home /tmp
mount -oremount,ro /

# optional mounts
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # already in /etc/resolv.conf
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/home /home

# optware mount bind (you may use a symlink instead if /opt is empty)
mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt  /opt
</pre>

<p>The final step is initializing the ipkg package management.</p>

<pre>
ipkg update
for i in ipkg-opt wget busybox; do ipkg install $i; done
</pre>

<p>This  completes a minimal OPTWARE setup.</p>

<p>OPTWARE  offers  1300+ packages, most of which should be useful  on
Android  (maybe  excluding  alsa/sound-related apps,  syslog  and  nfs
packages).  The  feed includes among others a minimal client-side  X11
setup,   servers   from   tftp  to  inetutils,   apache   and   samba,
cups/enscript/groff/ghostscript/mpage/psutils,
openvpn/strongswan/stunnel/vtun, bash, gcc and the kitchen sink, perl,
php, python, ruby, and even 9base/rc.</p>

<p>For  a  fairly  small  setup,  consider  installing  the  following
packages:  <i>mc vim tmux elinks w3m less perl python bash gzip  bzip2
unzip  p7zip  cpio  diffutils findutils grep mktemp  net-tools  netcat
openssh  openssl  openvpn  rsync  wget lsof  ltrace  strace  e2fsprogs
e2tools gnupg man man-pages xauth xterm autoconf gcc automake binutils
flex  make  optware-devel</i>. Missing dependencies will  be  resolved
automatically by ipkg (about 100 packages, 300M).</p>


<br>
<H4>Customizing the Environment for OPTWARE</H4>

<p>To  make OPTWARE available after rebooting, you need to restore the
above   changes   to  Android's   transient   rootfs   (symlinks,
mountpoints, possibly also mounts).</p>

<pre>
# file /system/xbin/OPTWARE

export OPTROOT=/x/optware # *** UNRELATED TO CHROOT despite PATH*** 

## /system: this is one-time and will survive reboots
#mount -oremount,rw /system
#( cd /etc &amp;&amp; ln -s /proc/mounts mtab ) 
#( cd /etc &amp;&amp; touch resolv.conf )
#mount -oremount,ro /system

## /: transient rootfs mod - required after each boot
# note that we might be able to remove some of the symlinks, as we
# now have a full OPTWARE setup (untested)
mount -oremount,rw /

# we _need_ a symlink to busybox here when bootstrapping,
# untested if we can remove any of our links in /lib and /bin
# afterwards (e.g. during updates of ipkg busybox), or whether 
# we always need the stuff (either busybox or bash symlinked to sh
# and GNU equivalents; outside of debian, dash had issues with Perl
# somewhere, so do not use dash for the /bin/sh symlink)
# be paranoid and guard the rm /bin/sh (in case a /bin/sh-using 
# non-Android system has the misfortune to suffer my OPTWARE install guide)
test -x $OPTROOT/bin/sh && ( rm /bin/sh 2>/dev/null; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/sh . )
( cd /bin &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/bin/* . 2&gt;/dev/null )   # only ldd for now  - android: usually unused
( cd /lib &amp;&amp; ln -s $OPTROOT/lib/* . 2&gt;/dev/null )   # libc and the like - android: unused except /lib/modules
mkdir /opt /home /tmp 2&gt;/dev/null
mount -oremount,ro /

# optional mounts
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf # already in /etc/resolv.conf
# mount -obind $OPTROOT/home /home

## optware mount bind (you may use a symlink instead if /opt is empty)
mount -obind $OPTROOT/opt  /opt

echo source /opt/optware.env for use of the optware environment
</pre>


<br>
<p>To use OPTWARE, you need to at least add OPTWARE to the  PATH
variable. In my case, I use these files and definitions:<p>

<pre>
# file /opt/optware.env

# we may need to also consider LD_LIBRARY_PATH, MANPATH, ... ?

export OPTWARE_POS="first"
[ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "first" ] &amp;&amp; PATH="/opt/bin:$PATH"
[ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "last"  ] &amp;&amp; PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"
</pre>

<pre>
# .bash_aliases.pj

function ioptware { test -d /opt || sudo OPTWARE; test -f /opt/optware.env &amp;&amp; . /opt/optware.env; }

if [ "$HOSTNAME_CHROOT" = "" ]; then
   # probably invoked via TERMIDE script or TERMIDE app
   ...
   [ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "first" ] &amp;&amp; PATH="/opt/bin:$PATH"
   [ "$OPTWARE_POS" = "last"  ] &amp;&amp; PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"
   ...
fi
</pre>


<br>     <p>For     further     shell    customization,     see     <a href="01_setup.html">first   article  and  the   TERMINAL   IDE/CHROOT
setup</a>, esp. the files .bash_aliases.pj and .bashrc.pj, as contained
in the article's tarball.</p>

<H4>OPTWARE Issues</H4>

<ul>
<li><i>screen</i> fails to work (but as this also happens in debian chroot - kernel!? - work-around: tmux)
<li>there is no <i>ipkg</i> man page (neither locally, in man-pages.ipk, nor online) - 
    <i>ipkg --help</i>, <a href="http://svn.nslu2-linux.org/svnroot/optware/trunk/sources/ipkg-opt/">OPTWARE's source patches</a> 
    and the <a href="http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_ipkg_package_management_system">buffalo-nas-central help</a> 
    are about the best resources to be found. <a href="http://handhelds.org">Handhelds.org</a> and the official sources there
    are currently offline (Dec 1, 2011 doesn't seem to be your

<H4>OPTWARE Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>OPTWARE compiling / package building <a href="http://dream.reichholf.net/wiki/Howto:IPK_Pakete_erstellen">Howto:IPK_Pakete_erstellen (German; (non)openembedded)</a>, <a href="http://www.optware-project.org/index.php?title=Add_a_Package_to_Optware">optware-project.org/index.php?title=Add_a_Package_to_Optware</a>. Note that the OPTWARE svn sources/* offers differential patches to one specific upstream source version, which is specified/fetched by make/&lt;package&gt;.mk
<li>Installation/ipkg documentation - see handhelds.org/ipkg links above in issues
</ul>


<br>
<h4>Size and Capability Comparison</h4>

<p>sshdroid  is  about 2M, the files in /system/xbin 10M: Basic file and
shell access  by adb and ssh. TERMINAL IDE  requires
another  120M:  This  permits light shell use and light local development  in  a
graphical  terminal  app - with some effort also  usable  from
outside  the TERMINAL IDE application (setup as of first article, part 2). </p>

<p>Adding  my  "fairly  small" OPTWARE setup takes another  300M  (108
packages),  while improving the shell environment with proper libc and
GNU  utilities,  gcc  and  non-SL4A  scripting  options,  some  server
software and a very basic xterm / X11 client.</p>

<p>In  constrast  the  debian  chroot  from article  1  parts  3+4  is
installed  on  a separate ext4 partition on the external sdcard,  with
currently about 3.5G (1200 packages) used by debian proper. It extends
the   Note   to  a  200g  mobile  non-cloud  _full_   remote-graphical
desktop-level    environment   including   Libre-Office,   LaTeX   and
unrestricted  development.  For comfort, all you need is some  box  to
invoke VNC on to connect to the Note. In a pinch, skip the comfort bit
and just use a local vnc-viewer on the Android itself. </p>

<p  class=anno>Android  2.3.6 on my Note weighs in at about 2.3GB  for
190 system and 300 user apps, with another few hundred MB found on the
internal  sdcard, not counting personal media files and backup  files.
With  near-similar  size, pure Android+Market only  offer  <B>some</B>
mobile  and graphical usability in the same form-factor and weight  of
200g  as  above, while <b>lacking</b> both proper shell use  and  true
desktop-level  capabilities (mobile, cloud - inclusive all  associated
issues - or otherwise).</p>

<h4>Distributions</H4>

<p>Non-Android roms and graphical distributions (usually only for a small number of ARM devices, mostly excluding Android hardware)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shr-project.org">SHR</a> is OE X freesmartphone. Might be a candidate to experiment with dual-booting. 
    Known to work as rom/GUI on some Androids such as the Nexus.

   For Zaurus and friends, angstrom may include a full rom from device boot to GUI (one of OPIE, GPE or X11/E17). Package feeds for a suitable architecture
   should be usable for a chroot on Android (no mention of rom/GUI on Android seen)
<li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/DeviceSupport">Ubuntu</a> (native X11/Unity can be used on a small list of ARM devices, no mention of Android tablets seen)

<p>Other ARM distributions (most likely requiring a chroot-setup; lxc isn't supported by my current kernel on the Note)</p>

<ul>
<li>OPTWARE (no chroot required, as decribed above)
<li>chroots of ARM builds of standard distributions like debian (see first article), 
    ubuntu, fedora (at least version 8)

<h3>Milestones in Increasing and Extending Update Availability Despite Vendor Whims</h3>

<p  class=anno>(doubles nicely as the list of milestones for improving
the speed of security fixes and updates)</a>

<p  align=center><i>Google and many embedded vendors are in the animal
trade  and  sold the GNU of the traditional GNU/Linux environment  for
space for a mere naked kernel Linux.</i></p>

<h4>Unix Shell and Remote GUI Updates and ...</H4>

<p>In the long run, to be used with new software, security patches and
bug  fixes,  any device needs to permit at minimum a chroot with  real
package  management  (which Market is <b>NOT BY FAR</b>, not even  for
non-system  components)  and hopefully vnc. At the latest,  chroot  or
similar  must be available, when the vendor has obsoleted the  device.
Otherwise,  the user degenerates to a mere remote-controlled usee  and
repeatedly replaces devices at the vendor's whim.</p>

<p  class=anno>Some Android vendors don't offer any support/updates at
all,  so the buy-replacement-device-interval of their dreams might  as
well be called a <b>monetary ZERO-DAY exploit</b>.</p>

<p>OPTWARE,  or better yet, a debian chroot (as installed on my  Note)
guarantees  a vendor-independent level of real longterm support  until
either  the device develops actual hardware issues or the user changes
his device use patterns sufficiently to consider a new device (say, to
read A4 documents full-screen without zooming).</p>

<p align=center><i>This puts the GNU back into - hmmm - gnu(chroot)/Linux</i></p>

<h4>... Newer Android Framework Updates by Custom-Rom to ...</h4>

<p>To permit secure use outside the home (and within: defense in depth
is  certainly  better  than  the  classic  one-packetfilter  fits  all
hard-shell-soft-core  LAN  idea),  a device also  needs  uptodate  and
secure methods to access the new applications, that is an uptodate GUI
with  at  least current versions of VNC-Viewer (for access to  current
apps in the chroot), browser and ssh.</p>

<p>As Android Market doesn't permit marketplace links/updating for rom
apps   (180+   on   a  modern  Android  2.3.6  device),  this   is   a
problem-in-wait  that can only be delayed by moving to custom roms, at
the  latest when the device ages out of vendor support. Still the same
broken  Android  idea  of  big all-in-one-updates,  but  at  least  an
available,  less tardy, less broken and more secure  (Android-creators
of    the   2012-safari-cross-domain-ads-crack-fame,   providers    of
carrier-IQ  fame,  device makers of Sony-Rootkit-fame)  option  rather
being  forced to wait for the official channel OTA update, which  many
Android devices never had and never will see.</p>

<p>However,  custom  roms  still suffer both  from  the  compatibility
limits  of  vendor-provided  blobs  (or possibly  stock  kernels,  cf.
Motorola  Milestone)  as  well as the all-in-one update  problem.  Add
Android  fragmentation  and custom rom support will wane later on,  as
will  marketplace  app availability. Even the chroot environment  will
suffer  some of that bitrot, as newer and missing kernel features will
preclude building or using some programs.</p>

<p>Note  that  custom  rom  availability  further  depends  on  vendor
behaviour and device popularity.</p>

<h4>... Long-Term Supported Native Linux (possibly also Dual-Booting)</h4>

<p>At  this  point in time, we can either happily accept any bugs  and
security  flaws.  Alternately  we can vow to only use  the  device  in
totally  secure  protected  environments  in as  secure  a  manner  as
possible.  Like  inside a bank tresor with the battery removed.</p>

<p>Or  we  can accept some loss of funtionality due to firmware  blobs
for  uncommon and crippled hardware components (most likely candidates
are  sensors,  maybe camera, and 3d acceleration, possibly  also  some
wifi/gsm  functionality) and consider switching (or dual-booting) to a
native   graphical   interface  and/or  a  native  kernel   (AOSP   or
official).</p>

<p>By this we also extend proper package management to the equivalents
of  the  rom / system apps and turn the chroot setup into  the  actual
device setup: all programs - maybe excluding kernel, X11 server itself
and  a  small  number  of  libraries  -  can  now  be  updated  mostly
independent  of  each  other  - no unnecessary  delays  introduced  by
needing  to  create / test / forge channel-wide legal arragements  for
<i>the</i>  one  and only single one-big-update-blob to bind them  all
(freezing features and bugs for at least a year until the next monster
update;  custom-roms  at  least  drop lawyers  and  channel  agreement
constraints,  but installing them is still a messy manual intervention
with  extra  backup/restore steps, when compared to the use of a  real
package management).</p>

<p>By  now  our  own official end of support only happens  for  either
dying  hardware/flash  memory, change of user requirements, or  device
hardware  being  actively dropped from Xorg (/wayland(?))  and  kernel
source code.</p>

<p align=center><i>Now we have fixed the case and obtained proper GNU/Linux.</i></p>

<p>However: <b>there is one more step left for real bliss</b></p>

<p>Kernel  and  X server installation are probably still  outside  the
package  management  or  at least pinned to specific  or  custom-built
versions.</p>

<p>For  proper long term support, the results of working X11 /  kernel
modifications  for  a device also need to be pushed upstream into  the
official  sources,  and  ideally also be packaged  by  embedded  Linux
distributions   (which  lag  in  tracking  upstream),  better  yet  by
non-embedded  classic  GNU-Linux distributions like debian:  a  native
setup  of  debian  unstable  installable with  only  a  little  manual
intervention   is   the  final  perfect   long-term   device   support
scenario.</p>

<p  class=anno>Otherwise, we're stuck at a series of  badly-repeatable
one shot demonstrations, that require some to huge effort ranging from
rebuilding  installs  with manual flashing to long compiles with  some
patching  to  porting/rebasing  old changes against current  Xorg  and
kernel sources.</p>

<p>Currently all native efforts I've found - listed below - still seem
stuck  at  the  incomplete  restricted   functionality   one-shot
demonstration  level.</p>
