<H1>Coping with Android</H1>

<hr>

<p>Also                  see                  the                   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/android">Android
directory  of  the  script-archive</a>.</p>

<p>Besides  some scripts, this directory contains a one-time  snapshot
of  my working android environment intended to complement the articles
below. </p>

<p>The snapshot contains scripts for android unix-side userspace,
a  collection  of  static armel binaries, the tree  structure  of  the
chroot  on the Galaxy Note, as well as scripts and configuration files
used  for  monitoring,  backup,  etc from a remote  linux  server  via
cron.</p>

<a href="01_setup.html"><H2>01 - Setting  up  the Samsung Galaxy Note as a Unix  Box</H2></a>

<p  class=anno>(or at least as much as we can get away with it,  given
Google's kernel patches)</p>

<p>This  article  is a demonstration of setting up an ordinary  <B>1GB
RAM  DUAL  CORE  PC</B> also known as <b>Samsung Galaxy  Note</b>  and
wrongly  accused to be merely a traditional style smartphone.</p>

<p>  The only difference to the current crop of tablets is the display
density. Comparing hardware specifications of Note and PC (you want an
USB host port for external hardware: you already have one installed on
the  Note), the only interesting difference is in software, and in the
encoded  usage  / user interface assumptions. And I consider  some  of
Google's  assumptions  (derived from RAM-starved PDAs) to  be  already
obsolete in the face of current hardware.</p>

<p  class=anno>Remember  Moore's Law - modern <i>real</i>  smartphones
just  <i>aren't</i>.  Phones that is. And restricting  usability  also
isn't. Smart that is.</p>

<p>So  for now, let's just prove Google wrong, and use the Galaxy Note
for  more than just remote USB storage and taking a few of your  files
along.</p>

<p>Let's escape from Google's dumb-down  getting-in-your-workflow
single-task  Android usage mode, while neither going full cloud  (with
all associated disadvantages) nor lugging around a laptop.</p>

<p>The  first  part  describes setting up enough of a real  Unix  user
space to actually permit proper use of the shell.</p>

<p>Building  on these basics, the second part looks at taking a  fully
customized  desktop  setup on the road: Create a  Desktop-size  DEBIAN
armel  CHROOT setup and make that a first class citizen in any LAN you
encounter  (ssh, file serving and filesystem mounting). The final step
is  running  a  local  X11 Desktop on the  Note,  using  the  chroot's
vncserver  or  Xvnc  (market: Xvnc). To access, either use  the  local
display of the Note or any PC with a vncviewer.</p>

<p  class=anno>This  setup  is  enough  for  normal  LibreOffice  text
editing,   programming  or  some  light  web  browsing  (firefox9  and
chromium-browser  fail,  iceweasel/firefox  3.5 and  the  webkit/gecko
based  browsers  work), even without swap: I've usually  beyond  350MB
free  (free+buffers+cache) before starting X, which is enough for X11,
some xterms, firefox and LibreOffice.</p>

<a href="02_twlaunch.html"><H2>02 - (Ab)Using TWLAUNCHER: Another Way of Helping Android Cope with Moore's Law</H2></a>

<p>I  cannot help but assume that Android devices were never  expected
to  grow  to  Deskop  size, considering  user  interface,  application
presentation  and  some sneak peeks into the framework  source.  Maybe
Google  wanted to be polite and offer the user to maybe install upto a
dozen apps of his own.</p>

<p>But  a  modern  Android runs on  different  hardware:  Desktop-size
displays  (1280x800)  coupled  with Desktop-size RAM (1GB)  and  Flash
sizes  already  suitable  to  a full-sized  Linux  or  Windows  "root"
installation. Available space and possibilities tend to be used, so we
have  standard  Android setups using 180 apps as part of the rom  blob
with  maybe 200 to 300 additional installs from the user.</p>

<p>Severe  growth  pains  and  unsuitable design  decisions  are  e.g.
visible  in system_server and twlauncher: Confront them with more than
a  dozen  or  two  sdcard application  "installs"  -  twlauncher  gets
unstable,  but system_server timeouts and the phone does a soft reboot
loop  (only  recoverable by adb shell and doing uninstalls of most  of
the  sdcard  apps).  The  framework also  regularly  forgets  assigned
application  numbers  (abused unix user id/group id) as logged in  the
shamefully  hidden  /data/system/uiderrors.txt. If you've an app  that
suddenly  only  force-closes on startup, this is the likely reason  as
affected  apps  are  incapable  of  accessing  their  own  files   and
databases.</p>

<p  class=anno>I  wonder what Google does the non-rooted user want  to
do? Probably sending the device in to service, and buy a second device
to survive until the slow (off-shore) service returns the (un)repaired
device?  Once again, the only usable, moderately up-to-date and secure
android device is a rooted one.</p>

<p>This  article describes an approach to use the default app launcher
of  the  Note to organize your apps and to reuse that data outside  of
the  launcher,  e.g.  in  conjunction with  titanium  backup  and  apk
management after e.g. flashing a new rom.</p>

<a href="03_context.html"><H2>03 - Android in Context: Security, Privacy, Permissions, Restrictions</H2></a>

<p>A  look  at the privacy and security implications  of  smartphones,
using  the  Galaxy  Note  as  an example. Also  some  notes  on  (not)
empowering users. For technical content, this sections montions the FW
firewall  script  from the previous article and takes a quick look  at
LBE,      Permissions-Denied     (both     market)     and     Android
permissions/intents/receivers.</p>

<p>Again,  part of the problem is misunderstanding and misrepresenting
desktop-class  portable  computers  as the  magical-but-dumb  physical
gadget  traditionally  called either PDA or smartphone.  The  inherent
capabilities   of   the  hardware  however   are   desktop-class   and
furthermore, the device is an always connected internet computer, with
all  the  inherent  security  issues  and  third-party  cravings  for
access to device and user profiling data.</p>


<p  class=anno>Note  that the issues raised are generic to  all  newer
smartphones and tablets.</p>
