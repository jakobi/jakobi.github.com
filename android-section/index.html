<H1>Coping with Android</H1>

<hr>

<p>Also                  see                  the                   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/android">Android
directory  of  the  script-archive</a>.</p>

<p>Besides  some scripts, this directory contains a one-time  snapshot
of  my working android environment intended to complement the articles
below.  The snapshot contains scripts for android unix-side userspace,
a  collection  of  static armel binaries, the tree  structure  of  the
chroot  on the Galaxy note, as well as scripts and configuration files
used  for  monitoring,  backup,  etc from a remote  linux  server  via
cron.</p>



<hr><H2>Setting  up  the Samsung Galaxy Note as a Unix  Box</H2>

<p  class=anno>(or at least as much as we can get away with it,  given
Google's kernel patches)</p>

<p>This  article is a demonstration of how to sanely setup an ordinary
<B>1GB RAM DUAL CORE PC</B> also known Samsung Galaxy Note and wrongly
accused  to  be  merely  a  traditional  style  smartphone.  The  only
difference  to the current crop of tablets is the display density. And
comparing  hardware  specifications  (you want an USB  host  port  for
external   hardware:  you  already  have  one  installed),  the   only
interesting  difference  is in software, and the encoded usage /  user
interface  assumptions. And some of Google's assumptions derived  from
RAM-starved  PDAs  are simply already obsolete in the face of  current
hardware.</p>

<p class=anno>emember Moore's Law - modern smartphone's just <i>aren't</i></p>

<p>So  for now, let's just prove Google wrong, and use the Galaxy Note
for  more than just remote USB storage and taking a few of your  files
along.  Let's  escape  from Google's dumbed-down  single-task  Android
usage  mode. With neither using much remote cloud storage nor  lugging
around additional hardware other than the Galaxy Note.</p>

<p>The  first  part  describes setting up enough of a real  Unix  user
space to actually permit proper use of the shell.</p>

<p>With  these  basics, the second part will take a look at  taking  a
fully  customized <b>non-cloud</b> desktop setup on the road: Create a
Desktop-size  DEBIAN CHROOT setup and make that a first class  citizen
in  any LAN you encounter (ssh, file serving and filesystem mounting).
Naturally,  you  don't want to scatter your files all over the  place,
but rather use your own computer to edit say a personal document using
OpenOffice/LibreOffice.  So  let's use the chroot's vncserver or  Xvnc
(market: Xvnc) and run X11 apps locally on the Note. To access, either
use the local display of the Note or any PC with a vncviewer.</p>

<H2>Another Way of Helping Android Cope with Moore's Law</H2>

<p>I  cannot help but assume that Android devices were never  expected
to  grow  to  Deskop  size, considering  user  interface,  application
presentation  and  some sneak peeks into the framework  source.  Maybe
Google  wanted to be polite and offer the user to install a dozen apps
of his own.</p>

<p>But  a  modern  Android runs on  different  hardware:  Desktop-size
displays  (1280x800)  coupled  with Desktop-size RAM (1GB)  and  Flash
sizes  already  suitable  to  a full-sized  Linux  or  Windows  "root"
installation. Available space and possibilities tend to be used, so we
have  standard  Android setups using 180 apps as part of the rom  blob
with maybe 200 to 300 additional installs from the user.</p>

<p>This  article describes an approach to use the default app launcher of
the  note to organize your apps and to reuse that data outside of  the
launcher,  e.g. in conjunction with titanium backup and apk management
after e.g. flashing a new rom.</p>

<H2>A look at the privacy and security implications of smartphones, 
using the Galaxy Note as an example</H2>

I take a look  at 

 what  I consider  to  be  both  intentional  and
unintentional  problems in treating desktop-class portable devices  as
traditional smartphones.
