<p>Also                  see                  the                   <a href="http://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/android">Android
directory  of  the  script-archive</a>.</p>

<p>Besides  some scripts, this directory contains a one-time  snapshot
of  my working Android environment intended to complement the articles
below. </p>

<p>The snapshot contains scripts for the Android shell,
a  collection  of  static armel binaries, the tree  structure  of  the
chroot  on the Galaxy Note, as well as scripts and configuration files
used  for  monitoring,  backup,  etc from a remote  Linux  server  via
cron.</p>

<H2><a href="01_setup.html">01 - Setting  up  the Samsung Galaxy Note as a Unix  Box</a></H2>

<p  class=anno><i>(or  at  least as much as we can get away  with,  given
Google's  Linux kernel  patches and dumbed-down kernel configuration)</i></p>

<p>This  article demonstrates a sane setup of GNU/Linux on an ordinary
last-year's  <B>1-GB-RAM  DUAL-CORE PC</B> (also known  as  <b>Samsung
Galaxy Note</b>).</p>

<p>The  Note  is  often  wrongly accused to be a  less  powerful  mere
internet  or media tablet or a traditional-style smartphone. Some even
combine  both  insults and call it a <i>phablet</i>. VOIP, some  cheap
prehistoric  gsm feature plus small weight seem to be too  distracting
to perceive the similarity to PC specifications.</p>

<p>The  only difference to the best of the current crop of tablets  is
the   display  density.  Excluding  weight  as  well  as   64bit   and
virtualization CPU features, a comparison in hardware specifications
of  Note  vs  PC  doesn't show anything of  interest  lacking  on  the
Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Want  to connect the Note as an USB drive to a PC? You need an USB host
port?  Want to transfer data to an USB Stick? Use the USB OTG port.
<li>Want  HDMI? Connection  cable available. 
<li>Want to use a keyboard or mouse?  Connect by either USB or bluetooth. 
<li>Want to use an AP? Want to use as an AP? You  got both.
</ul>

<p> So the only remaining interesting difference  is  in
software, and in the encoded usage / user interface assumptions. And I
consider  some of Google's assumptions (derived from RAM-starved PDAs of yore)
to be already obsolete in the face of current hardware.</p>

<p  class=anno>Remember  Moore's Law - modern <i>real</i>  smartphones
just  <i>aren't</i>.  Just phones that is. And  restricting  usability
just also isn't. Smart that is.</p>

<p>So  for now, let's just prove Google wrong, and use the Galaxy Note
for  more than just SMS or USB storage for taking a few of your  files
along.</p>

<p><i>Let's  escape  from  Google's  dumb-down   getting-in-your-workflow
single-task Android usage mode, and put the GNU back in GNU/Linux</i>.</p>

<p>You  gain  use of a full Desktop everywhere you are, while  neither
going full cloud (with all associated disadvantages) nor having to lug
around a 20-times-heavier laptop.</p>

<p>The  first  part  investigates the device and contains  some  notes
of available  resources and rooting.</p>

<p>The  second  part describes setting up enough of a real  Unix  user
space to actually permit proper use of the Android shell.</p>

<p>Building  on these basics, the third part looks at creating a  full
customized  Linux  setup  for the road: Create a  Desktop-size  DEBIAN
armel  CHROOT setup and make that a first class citizen in any LAN you
encounter  (ssh,  file  serving  and filesystem  mounting,  with  some
automation for the home WLAN).</p>

<p>The  final  step is running a local X11 Desktop on the Note,  using
the  chroot's vncserver or Xvnc (market: Xvnc). To access, either  use
the local display of the Note or any PC with a vncviewer.</p>

<p  class=anno>The Note and this setup is more than enough for  normal
OpenOffice  or LibreOffice text editing, programming or some light web
browsing in X11.</p>

<H2><a href="02_twlaunch.html">02 - (Ab)Using TWLAUNCHER: Helping Android Cope with Moore's Law</a></H2>

<p>I  cannot help but assume that Android devices were never  expected
to  grow  up  and  achieve (virtual) Desktop  size,  considering  user
interface,  application  presentation  and some sneak peeks  into  the
framework  source. Maybe Google wanted to be polite and offer the user
to maybe install upto a dozen apps of his own.</p>

<p>But  a  modern  Android runs on  different  hardware:  Desktop-size
displays  (1280x800)  coupled  with Desktop-size RAM (1GB)  and  Flash
memory  sizes already suitable for a full-sized Linux or Windows "root"
installation. Available space and possibilities tend to be used, so we
have  standard  Android setups using 180 apps as part of the rom  blob
with maybe 200 to 300 additional installs from the user.</p>

<p>Severe  growth  pains  and  unsuitable design  decisions  are  e.g.
visible    in    <i>system_server</i>   and   Samsung's    <i>TouchViz
twlauncher</i>:  Confront  them with more than a dozen or  two  sdcard
application   "installs"   -  <i>twlauncher</i>  gets  unstable,   but
<i>system_server</i>  timeouts  and the phone does a soft reboot  loop
(only  recoverable by <i>adb shell</i> and doing uninstalls of most of
the  sdcard  apps).  The  framework also  regularly  forgets  assigned
application  numbers  (abused unix user id/group id) as logged in  the
shamefully  hidden  /data/system/uiderrors.txt. If you've an app  that
suddenly  only  force-closes on startup, this is the likely reason  as
affected  apps  are  incapable  of  accessing  their  own  files   and
databases.</p>

<p  class=anno>I  wonder what Google does the non-rooted user want  to
do? Probably sending the device in to service, and buy a second device
to survive until the slow (off-shore) service returns the (un)repaired
device?</p>

<p    class=anno>Once    again,    the   only    usable,    moderately
up-to-date/secure  Android device is a non-provider-locked rooted  one
(this specifically excludes signed-bootloader-crippled models from the
likes  of Motorola, e.g. the early-on abandoned Motorola Milestone,  a
disastrous mess in every area but hardware).</p>

<p><a href="02_twlaunch.html">The    second   article    "(Ab)Using
TWLAUNCHER"</a>  describes an approach to use the default app launcher
of  the Note to organize hundreds of apps and then to reuse that  data
outside  of  the application, maybe in conjunction with  backup  files
created by <i>titanium backup</i> to do some apk management after e.g.
flashing a new ROM.</p>

<p  class=anno>A similar approach is possible for anything that either
categorizes applications or for any launcher application that offers a
folder  concept.  Of  course,  if those applications  would  just  use
symlinks  or similar filesystem-level concepts, the annoying  database
extraction  step wouldn't be required at all, while offering the  user
on the Android transparent access and editing capability by just using
a file browser.</p>

<H2><a href="03_context.html">03 - Android in Context: Security, Privacy, Permissions, Restrictions</a></H2>

<p>A  look  at the privacy and security implications  of  smartphones,
using  the  Galaxy  Note  as  an example. Also  some  notes  on  (not)
empowering users.</p>

<p>For  technical  content,  this sections mentions  the  FW  firewall
script  from the previous article, checks recurring netstat output for
network connectivity and takes a quick look at LBE, Permissions-Denied
(both market) and Android permissions/intents/receivers.</p>

<p>Again,  part of the problem is misunderstanding and misrepresenting
desktop-class  portable  computers  as the  magical-but-dumb  physical
gadget  traditionally  called either PDA or smartphone.  The  inherent
capabilities   of   the  hardware  however   are   desktop-class   and
furthermore, the device is an always connected internet computer, with
all  the  inherent  security  issues  and  third-party  cravings  for
access to device and user profiling data.</p>


<p  class=anno>Note  that the issues raised are generic to  all  newer
smartphones and tablets.</p>
