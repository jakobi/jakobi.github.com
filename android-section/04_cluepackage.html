<H2>Android Article 04 - CluePackage (-Management) Manifesto</H2>

<p  class=anno>Note that killing the all-in-one-update idea as well as
dropping  the articial Market restrictions against Market-Links of rom
component  apk  packages would go pretty far in reducing  the  current
tardiness.  Add  inter-app  dependency  tracking  (use  case:  dolphin
browser  and  plugins,  and many more) and you nearly have  a  package
management.  When we are at it, we could also drop other needless  and
artificial market restrictions like the absurd Android Market 101, 403
and 509 errors - or the sudden, sometimes-vanishing-again inability of
the  Market app to find its own installed applications (nicely  making
an update of installed Market apps impossible). Vanishing market-links
are    just   as   funny   for   keeping   apps   uptodate.   Or   the
paid-app-is-not-compatible  server  error  on the web  site  strangely
occuring  only  for  security-related apps with  identical  free  test
versions.  Most of the client-side issues require one of the following
solutions for repair: a) root, b) buy a newer Android c) buy an iphone
to  suffer different errors or d) wipe the Android and invest hours to
days  to  reinstall everything. Are that "new age  customer  retention
strategies".</p>

Or  paging through a list of 200 apps found by a search on the  Market
website.  After  half of the result pages, we suddenly only get  empty
pages. Renaming the Market to "Play" is just introducing a more appropriate name for this mess. 
It doesn't fix the underlaying lack of package management issue, nor the horrible framework implementation (at least in 2.3; packages.xml!?)
nor the slew of bugs called "Market" badly substituting for package management.
Google's lack of response and fixes (or at least work-arounds) for Market issues doesn't help at all.

Samsung easily proves that it's not hardware that cripples Android.

<p  class=anno>Of  course,  the  proper answer would  be  to  separate
Android  2.3 abysmal crashy core security-cum-packaging-component into
multiple  separate  tasks:  One  task  for  a  lightweight  persistant
database  setups  instead  of  reparsing/rebuilding  packages.xml  and
forgetting  assigned  application IDs (uiderrors/force-close) on  each
boot.  One  task  for permission and security enforcement -  the  only
required core component at run time. One task for package installation
and  extracting  permissions, features et al. One additional task  for
inter-package   dependencies.  And  all  of  these   tasks   excluding
enforcement  have  been  handled solidly for  decades  by  established
traditional   package   management  setups  like   dpkg/aptitude   and
predecessors.  No more need to run Market Fixer / FIXPERM on each boot
to  clean up Google's Market mess.</p>

<p  class=anno> There's not even a need for making big changes to  the
Market  - package translation or slightly modifying a package  manager
for a differing package format isn't that difficult at all. Retain the
html  pages  of the Market for interactive searching, move apps  to  a
repository,  with  free app requirements maybe just  already  resolved
inside  the  package management on the client, while more  interesting
restrictions  like paid app access or export restrictions still can be
dealt  with  by  using public key ideas and dynamic server  side  file
serving.  Not  exactly Rocket Science. Rather Stone-Age ideas  on  the
Web.</p>
