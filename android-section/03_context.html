<p>Still polishing notes - version 1 to be online before 20120220 (FAIL)</p>

<hr>
<p>A  look  at the privacy and security implications  of  smartphones,
using  the  Galaxy  Note  as  an example. Also  some  notes  on  (not)
empowering users.</p>

<p>Again,  part of the problem is misunderstanding and misrepresenting
desktop-class  portable  computers  as the  magical-but-dumb  physical
gadget  traditionally  called either PDA or smartphone.  The  inherent
capabilities   of   the  hardware  however   are   desktop-class   and
furthermore, the device is an always connected internet computer, with
all  the  inherent  security  issues  and  third-party  cravings  for
access to device and user profiling data.</p>

<p class=anno>{but this is merely the optimistic view point}</p>

<p  class=anno>{it sure takes quite a bit of time once in a while, but
Richard  M.  Stallman's caution is unfortunately vindicated  time  and
again}</p>

when  considering modern it and hardware aspects: like battery  saving
by  local caching instead of network access: the implementation  costs
both includes the savings from the reduced load of our servers and the
reduced value of the user profile per user.

(but still android-only, and some questionable alternatives, and no solution of updates and security ...)

closing the soruce: unlikely as they already have most of the benefits w/o the pr damage. 
But is it really open as in cook-your-own-easily in the first place??


reinventing wheels, with small differences:
sonderlocken: ipc -> binder
shm -/-> ashmem (lklm: a small extension to ramfs is better)

logget -> http://elinux.org/Mainline_Android_logger_project

https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1IC9yOXj7j6cdLLxWEBAGRL6wl97tFxgjLUEHIX3MSTs&pli=1 systemd/journal vs syslog analysis

Logging is a crucial part of service management. On Unix, most running services connect to syslog to write log messages. In systemd, we built logging into the very core of service management: since Fedora 16 all services started are automatically connected to syslog with their standard output and error output. Regardless whether a service is started at early boot or during normal operation, its output ends up in the system logs. Logging is hence something so central, that it requires configuration to avoid it, and is turned from opt-in to opt-out. The net effect is a much more transparent, debuggable and auditable system. Transparency is no longer just an option for the knowledgeable, but the default.




big firmware blob and chain vs security updates

lack of proper package management

mixing security and package management - Oops, I xml'ed it again

core of the framework's  security and package management and the packages.xml/sdcard/uiderr.txt symptoms of its scaling problems. 

FW - firewall lack

an interesting use of OSS not returning anything

use of OSS to disempower 

recurring netstat output for network connectivity

LBE, Permissions-Denied (both  market) and Android permissions/intents/receivers
including the soft denial and IMEI issue in CM.

Summary:  I don't even value certain subsets of my privacy that  much.
But  the lack of bug and security fixes, artificially shortened device
life time is already a bit much, even w/o adding in the privacy issues.

(Naturally,  when considering business secrets, any smartphones  ought

a la thin clients

to  be forbidden, or at very least restricted to graphics-only  access
to terminal servers permitting working on ... using e.g RDP or VNC)

<p  class=anno>Note  that the issues raised are generic to  all  newer
smartphones and tablets.</p>
