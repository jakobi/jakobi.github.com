<h3>Milestones in Increasing and Extending Update Availability Despite Vendor Whims</h3>

<p  class=anno>(doubles nicely as the list of milestones for improving
the speed of security fixes and updates)</p>

<p  align=center><i>Google and many embedded vendors are in the animal trade<br>
and have sold the GNU of the traditional GNU/Linux  environment<br>
for space to retain a mere skinned kernel Linux.</i></p>

<h4>Unix Shell and Remote GUI Updates and ...</H4>

<p>In  the  long run, to be used with new software as well as  current
security  patches/bug  fixes,  all Android devices need to  permit  at
minimum  a chroot with real package management (which Market is <b>NOT
BY  FAR</b>,  not  even for non-system components;  chrooting  implies
rooting)  and hopefully vnc. At the latest, chroot or similar must  be
available  as  option  for  the user as soon as  the  the  vendor  has
obsoleted  the  device.  Otherwise,  the user degenerates  to  a  mere
remote-controlled usee and repeatedly replaces devices at the vendor's
whim.</p>

<p  class=anno>Some Android vendors do not offer any support/updates at
all,  so the buy-replacement-device-interval of their dreams might  as
well be called a <b>monetary ZERO-DAY exploit</b>.</p>

<p><a href="01b_setup_alternatives.html">OPTWARE</a>, or better  yet,
<a href="01_setup.html">a debian chroot (as installed on my Note)</a>
guarantees  a  vendor-independent  level  of  real  longterm   support
hopefully  lasting  until either the device develops  actual  hardware
issues  or  the user changes his use patterns  sufficiently  to
consider  a new device (say, to read A4 documents full-screen  without
zooming).</p>

<p  class=anno>Side  benefits of a debian chroot on a  modern  Android
like   the  Samsung  Galaxy  Note:  a  <b>portable  complete  uptodate
local/non-cloud  desktop</b>,  independent of the exotic rare  Android
OTA  rom  update (which is bound to be already out-of-date long  before
being  transmitted  - if ever).</p>

<p  class=anno>If you want a graphical presentation rather than my own
debian  chroot do-it-yourself HOWTO sketch for rooted Androids,  check
out   the   most   recent  ubuntu  chroot  variant  in  form   of   <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android">Canonical's   Ubuntu  for
Android</a>  or  treat yourself with an in-the-flesh test run  of  the
Motorola  Atrix,  which  happens to be the first Android  to  take  up
Canonical's offer.</p>

<p align=center><i>Chrooting puts most of the GNU back into - hmmm - gnoot/Linux</i></p>



<h4>... Newer Android Framework Updates by Custom-Rom to ...</h4>

<p>To permit secure use outside the home (and within: defense in depth
is    certainly    better   than   the   classic   LAN   concept    of
one-packetfilter-fits-all  hard-shell-soft-core), a device also  needs
uptodate and secure methods to access the new applications; that is an
uptodate graphical user interface comprising at the very least current
versions  of  VNC-Viewer (for access to current apps in  the  chroot),
browser and ssh.</p>

<p>As Android Market doesn't permit marketplace links/updating for rom
apps   (180+   on   a  modern  Android  2.3.6  device),  this   is   a
problem-in-waiting  that can only be delayed by moving to custom roms,
at the latest when the device ages out of vendor support. A custom rom
is   still   the   same  old,  same  broken  Android   idea   of   big
all-in-one-updates,  but at least it offers an available, less  tardy,
less  broken  and  more  secure alternative  (Android-creator  of  the
2012-safari-cross-domain-ad-network-crack-fame,   device   makers   of
Sony-rootkit-fame  or Motorola-device-signed-locking-fame, as well  as
providers  of  carrier-IQ fame) to forced passive waiting  for  either
exploits  and  other malware, or for the official channel  OTA  update
with  embedded  bloatware;  and  an OTA update is a  rare  sight  many
Android devices never have encountered and never will see.</p>


<p>However,  custom  roms  still suffer both  from  the  compatibility
limits  of  vendor-provided  blobs  (or possibly  stock  kernels,  cf.
Motorola Milestone) as well as the already mentioned all-in-one update
problem.  Add Android fragmentation and custom rom support will  still
wane  (albeit  later), as will marketplace app availability. Even  the
chroot  environment  will  suffer some of that bitrot,  as  newer  and
missing   kernel  features  will  preclude  building  or  using   some
programs.</p>

<p class=anno>Note  that  custom  rom  availability  further  depends  on  vendor
behaviour and device popularity (cf. Motorola).</p>

<p  class=anno>(this  corresponds  to  the current setup  of  my  Note
(debian  chroot  +  custom rom), which - according to Samsung  -  will
probably  last  until early 2013)



<h4>... Long-Term Supported Native Linux (possibly also Dual-Booting)</h4>

<p>Without  rom updates - official channel or otherwise, we can either
gladly embrace any bugs and security flaws. Alternatively we can vow to
only  use  the device in totally secure protected environments  in  as
secure a manner as possible. Like inside a locked massive bank safe, with the device
power supply and battery being removed.</p>

<p>Or  we  can accept some loss of funtionality due to firmware  blobs
for  uncommon/crippled hardware components (most likely candidates are
sensors,  maybe  camera,  and  3d  acceleration,  possibly  also  some
wifi/gsm  functionality) and consider switching (or dual-booting) to a
native  graphical  interface  and/or a native kernel  (Xorg;  AOSP  or
official  kernel).  Functionality loss should be less  problematic  on
tablets,  given  typical usage. As for phone/rild issues, they  should
become  less  problematic  in  the  future,  as  providers  ought   to
increasingly  move to VOIP proper, as their transmission standards and
protocols already do year by year.</p>

<p>By  moving to native X11, we also extend proper package  management
to  the equivalents of the rom / system apps and turn the chroot setup
inside-out  into  the  actual  device  setup:  all  programs  -  maybe
excluding  kernel, X11 server itself and a small number of libraries -
can  now  be  updated  (mostly) independent of  each  other:  no  more
unnecessary  delays  introduced  by needing to create / test  /  forge
channel-wide   legal  arragements  for  <i>the  one  and  only  single
one-big-update-blob  to bind them all</i> (freezing features and  bugs
for  at one year or more until the next monster update; custom-roms at
least  trade  lawyers  and channel agreement  constraints  for  update
frequency  and  short  delays, but installing them is  still  a  messy
manual  intervention with extra backup/restore steps, when compared to
the workings of a real package management).</p>

<p  class=anno>By now our own official end of support only happens for
either  dying  hardware/flash memory, change of user requirements,  or
device  hardware  being actively dropped from Xorg and  kernel  source
code.  Which only hurts in case no-one chooses to fork or maintain  the
old source code branch for another few years.</p>

<p align=center><i>Now we have solved the case, fixed the spelling and
restored the proper environmentally sound and sustainable relationship
of    the   descendants   of   archaeopteryx   and   artiodactyls   to
GNU/Linux.</i></p>

<p>However: <b>there is one more step left to attain bliss</b>.</p>

<p>Kernel  and  X  server installation are likely outside  of  package
management   or   at   least  pinned  to  specific   or   custom-built
versions.</p>

<p>For  proper long term support, the results of working X11 /  kernel
modifications  for  a device also need to be pushed upstream into  the
official  sources,  and  ideally also be packaged  by</p>

<li>embedded  Linux distributions   (which  lag  in  tracking  upstream),
<li>better  yet  by non-embedded  classic  GNU-Linux distributions like debian.
/ul

<p>A  native  setup of debian unstable installable with only a  little
manual  intervention  is  the final <b>perfect long-term  device  support
scenario</b>.</p>

<p  class=anno>Otherwise, we're stuck at a series of  badly-repeatable
one shot demonstrations, that require some to huge effort ranging from
rebuilding  installs  with manual flashing to long compiles with  some
patching  to  porting/rebasing  old changes against current  Xorg  and
kernel sources.</p>

<hr>

<p>Current  <b>state  of the art</b> for Android devices:  all  native
efforts      I      have      found      -      listed      in      <a href="01b_setup_alternatives.html">Setup Alternatives</a> - still seem
stuck    at   the   incomplete   restricted   functionality   one-shot
demonstration level.</p>
