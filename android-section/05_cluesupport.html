<h3>Milestones in Increasing and Extending Update Availability Despite Vendor Whims</h3>

<p  class=anno>(doubles nicely as the list of milestones for improving
the speed of security fixes and updates)</a>

<p  align=center><i>Google and many embedded vendors are in the animal
trade  and have sold the GNU of the traditional GNU/Linux  environment
for space to a mere naked kernel Linux.</i></p>

<h4>Unix Shell and Remote GUI Updates and ...</H4>

<p>In the long run, to be used with new software, security patches and
bug  fixes,  any device needs to permit at minimum a chroot with  real
package  management  (which Market is <b>NOT BY FAR</b>, not even  for
non-system  components)  and hopefully vnc. At the latest,  chroot  or
similar  must be available, when the vendor has obsoleted the  device.
Otherwise,  the user degenerates to a mere remote-controlled usee  and
repeatedly replaces devices at the vendor's whim.</p>

<p  class=anno>Some Android vendors do not offer any support/updates at
all,  so the buy-replacement-device-interval of their dreams might  as
well be called a <b>monetary ZERO-DAY exploit</b>.</p>

<p><a href="">OPTWARE</a>, or better yet, <a href="">a debian  chroot
(as installed on my Note)</a> guarantees a vendor-independent level of
real longterm support until either the device develops actual hardware
issues  or  the user changes his device use patterns  sufficiently  to
consider  a new device (say, to read A4 documents full-screen  without
zooming).</p>

<p  class=anno>Side  benefits of a debian chroot on a  modern  Android
like   the  Samsung  Galaxy  Note:  a  <b>portable  complete  uptodate
local/non-cloud  desktop</b>,  independent of the exotic rare  Android
OTA rom update, which is already out-of-date before being transmitted.
If  you  want  a graphical presentation rather than my  debian  chroot
do-it-yourself   HOWTO  sketch  for  rooted  Androids,  check  out  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android">Canonical  and Ubuntu for
Android</a>  or  have  a  physical look at  Canonical's  take  on  the
Motorola Atrix.</p>

<p align=center><i>This puts the GNU back into - hmmm - gnu(chroot)/Linux</i></p>

<h4>... Newer Android Framework Updates by Custom-Rom to ...</h4>

<p>To permit secure use outside the home (and within: defense in depth
is  certainly  better  than  the  classic  one-packetfilter  fits  all
hard-shell-soft-core  LAN  idea),  a device also  needs  uptodate  and
secure methods to access the new applications, that is an uptodate GUI
with  at  least current versions of VNC-Viewer (for access to  current
apps in the chroot), browser and ssh.</p>

<p>As Android Market doesn't permit marketplace links/updating for rom
apps   (180+   on   a  modern  Android  2.3.6  device),  this   is   a
problem-in-waiting  that can only be delayed by moving to custom roms, at
the  latest when the device ages out of vendor support. Still the same
broken  Android  idea  of  big all-in-one-updates,  but  at  least  an
available,  less tardy, less broken and more secure  (Android-creators
of  the  2012-safari-cross-domain-ads-crack-fame,  device  makers   of
Sony-Rootkit-fame,  providers of carrier-IQ fame) option rather  being
forced to wait for the official channel OTA update, which many Android
devices never had and never will see.</p>


<p>However,  custom  roms  still suffer both  from  the  compatibility
limits  of  vendor-provided  blobs  (or possibly  stock  kernels,  cf.
Motorola  Milestone)  as  well as the all-in-one update  problem.  Add
Android  fragmentation  and custom rom support will wane later on,  as
will  marketplace  app availability. Even the chroot environment  will
suffer  some of that bitrot, as newer and missing kernel features will
preclude building or using some programs.</p>

<p>Note  that  custom  rom  availability  further  depends  on  vendor
behaviour and device popularity.</p>

<p  class=anno>(this  corresponds  to  the current setup  of  my  Note
(debian  chroot  +  custom rom), which - according to Samsung  -  will
probably  last  until early 2013)



<h4>... Long-Term Supported Native Linux (possibly also Dual-Booting)</h4>

<p>At  this  point in time, we can either happily accept any bugs  and
security  flaws.  Alternately  we can vow to only use  the  device  in
totally  secure  protected  environments  in as  secure  a  manner  as
possible.  Like  inside a locked bank tresor with the battery removed.</p>

<p>Or  we  can accept some loss of funtionality due to firmware  blobs
for  uncommon and crippled hardware components (most likely candidates
are  sensors,  maybe camera, and 3d acceleration, possibly  also  some
wifi/gsm  functionality) and consider switching (or dual-booting) to a
native  graphical interface and/or a native kernel (AOSP or official).
Functionality  loss  should  be  less problematic  on  tablets,  given
typical  usage. As for Call/phone/rild/gsm issues, they should  become
less  problematic  in the future, as providers ought to move  to  VOIP
proper,  as their transmission standards and protocols already do year
by year.</p>

<p>By this we also extend proper package management to the equivalents
of  the  rom / system apps and turn the chroot setup into  the  actual
device setup: all programs - maybe excluding kernel, X11 server itself
and  a  small  number  of  libraries  -  can  now  be  updated  mostly
independent  of  each  other  - no unnecessary  delays  introduced  by
needing  to  create / test / forge channel-wide legal arragements  for
<i>the</i>  one  and only single one-big-update-blob to bind them  all
(freezing features and bugs for at least a year until the next monster
update;  custom-roms  at  least  drop lawyers  and  channel  agreement
constraints,  but installing them is still a messy manual intervention
with  extra  backup/restore steps, when compared to the use of a  real
package management).</p>

<p>By  now  our  own official end of support only happens  for  either
dying  hardware/flash  memory, change of user requirements, or  device
hardware  being  actively dropped from Xorg (/wayland(?))  and  kernel
source code.</p>

<p align=center><i>Now we have solved the case and restored the proper
environmentally  sound and sustainable relationship of the descendants
of archaeopteryx and artiodactyls to GNU/Linux.</i></p>

<p>However: <b>there is one more step left for real bliss</b></p>

<p>Kernel  and  X server installation are probably still  outside  the
package  management  or  at least pinned to specific  or  custom-built
versions.</p>

<p>For  proper long term support, the results of working X11 /  kernel
modifications  for  a device also need to be pushed upstream into  the
official  sources,  and  ideally also be packaged  by  embedded  Linux
distributions   (which  lag  in  tracking  upstream),  better  yet  by
non-embedded  classic  GNU-Linux distributions like debian:  a  native
setup  of  debian  unstable  installable with  only  a  little  manual
intervention   is   the  final  perfect   long-term   device   support
scenario.</p>

<p  class=anno>Otherwise, we're stuck at a series of  badly-repeatable
one shot demonstrations, that require some to huge effort ranging from
rebuilding  installs  with manual flashing to long compiles with  some
patching  to  porting/rebasing  old changes against current  Xorg  and
kernel sources.</p>

<p>Currently   all   native  efforts  I've  found  -  listed   in   <a href="01b_setup_alternatives.html">Setup Alternatives</a> - still seem
stuck    at   the   incomplete   restricted   functionality   one-shot
demonstration level.</p>
